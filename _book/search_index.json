如果无法拓展，则会在其每一个文件对应的编译模块中产生一个static函数实体。\nC++在布局以及存取时间上主要的額外负担是由virtual引起，包括：\n\nvirtual function 用以支持一个有效率的“执行期绑定\"\nvirtual base class 用以实现多次出现在继承体系中的base class，有一个单一而被共享的实体\n\nc++

members则被存放在所有 的class object之外。Static和non static function members也被放在所有的class object之外．Virtual functions则以两个步骤支持之：\n\n每一个class产生出一堆指向virtual functions的指针，放在表格之中，这个表格被称为virtual table(vtbl)\n每一个class object 被添加了一个指针，指向其class的virtual table.通常这个指针被称为vptr. vptr的设定（setting）和重置（resetting）都由每一个class的contructor, destructor和copy assignment运算符自动完成,每个class所关联的type_info object（用以支持runtime identification,RTTI）也经由virtual table被指出来，通常是放在表格的第一个slot处·\n\n如下class Point声明\n\n其对象模型如下\n\n加上继承\nc++支持单一继承，多重继承，虚拟继承，如下\n\n\n\n在虚拟继承的情况下，base class不管在继承串链中被派生（derived）多少次，永远只会在其派生对象中存在一个实体（称为subobject）·例如某个 iostream object之中就只有virtual ios base class 的一个subobject.\n\nC++最初采用的继承模型，base class subobject的data members被直接放置于derived class object中．这提供了对base class members最紧凑而且最有效率的存取，缺点呢？当然就是：base class members的任何改变，包括增加、移除或改变类型等等，都使得所有用到此base class或其derived class的相关模块都必须重新编译．\n自C++2.0起才新导入的virtual base class，需要一些间接的base class 表现方法．Virtual base class的原始模型是在class object 中为每一个有关联的virtual base class加上一个指针，其它演化出来的模型则若不是导入一个virtual base class table,就是拓展原存在的virtual table, 以便于维护每一个virtual base class的位置（在virtual

level是private，而struct是public.\n当然有些在c程序中经常被使用的巧计，比如柔性数组，在struct的最后声明一个单一元素的数组，该struct于是拥有可变大小的数组，比如\nstruct mumbel{\n//...\nchar pc[1];\n}\n\nstruct mumbel * pm=(struct mumbel *)malloc(sizeof(struct mumbel)+strlen(string)+1);\n\nstrcpy(&(pm->pc),string)\n\n如果我们在c++中也这样使用，但是c++中对应的class中有多个access section, 并且也可能有虚函数，有基类，这时候，在class的末尾再声明一个单一元素的数组，这个成员实际并不一定存储在对象的末尾，因此也就不能像以上那样使用\nclass

sections中的各笔数据，排列次序就不一定了．上述的声明中，前述的c伎俩或许可以有效运行，或许不能，需视protected data members被放在private data members的前面或后面而定\n同样的道理,base classes和derived classes的data members的布局也没有谁先谁后的强制规定，因而也就不保证前述的C伎俩一定有效. virtual functions的存在也会使得前述的C伎俩的有效性成为问号。所以不要在C++程序中这样用。\n三种程序设计范式\nC++程序设计支持三种设计范式\n\n程序模型（procedural model），像C一样\n\nADT( abstract data type model, 抽象数据类型模型)，类中封装了数据，对外只提供操作接口\n\n面向对象模型(object-oriented model)·在此模型中有一些彼此相关的class，通过一个base class（用以提供共通接口）被封装起来·\n\n\n当程序设计使用面向对象模型，并且需要使用多态的性质时，需要通过base class的指针或者引用来调用接口。\n\n\n虽然你可以直接或间接处理继承体系中的一个base class object，但只有通过pointer或reference的间接处理，才支持OO程序设计所需的多态性质。上个例子中的thing2的定义和运用，是OO paradigm中一个良好的例证. thing1的定义和运用则逸出了OO的习惯，它反映的是一个ADT paradigm的良好行为,thing1行为是好是坏，视程序员的意图而定．在此范例中，它的行为非常有可能不是你要的！\n在OO paradigm之中，程序员需要处理一个未知实体，它的类型虽然有所界定，却有无穷可能。这组类型受限于其继承体系，然而该体系理论上没有深度和广度的限制。原则上，被指定的object的真实类型在每一个特定执行点之前，是无法解析的。在C++中，只有通过pointers和references的操作才能够完成。相反地，在ADT paradigm中程序员处理的是一个拥有固定而单一类型的实体,它在编译时期就已经完全解析好了。\n举个例子，下面这组声明：\n\n你绝对没有办法确定地说出px或rx到底指向何种类型的objects，你只能够说它要不就是Library_materials object,要不就是后者的一个派生object，我们倒是可以确定，dx只能是一个Library_materials object\nC++ 通过以下方法支持多态\n\n经由一组隐含的转化操作，例如把一个derived class指针转化为一个指向其public base class的指针：\nshape *ps = new circle();\n经由virtual function 机制\nps->rotate();\n经由dynamic_cast和typeid运算符\nif(circle *c = dynamic_cast(ps) )...\n\n需要多少内存才能表现一个class object?\n\nnon static data members总和的大小\n为了alignment而padding的字节\n支持virtual的overhead\n\n假设有基类ZooAnimal,声明如下，并且定义了ZooAnimal对象za,和ZooAnimal的指针pza\n\n\n假设za存储在地址1000处，其内存布局如下\n\n假设我们又声明了派生类Bear,并且定义了Bear对象和指针\n\n则其对象和指针的内存布局如下\n\n现在假设有如下代码\nBear b;\nZooAnimal *pz=&b;\nBear* pb=&b\n\npz 和pb都指向b对象的起始地址处，只不过通过pz指针仅仅能访问到ZooAnimal大小的内存范围，而通过pb可以访问全部的b对象大小的内存范围。\n除了ZooAnimal subobject中的members,不能通过pz直接处理Bear中的members,唯一的例外是可以调用虚函数\n\n注意上述代码中的cell_block应该是public,不然不能被外部访问\n如果我们调用\npz->rotate();\npz的类型将在编译时期决定以下两点\n\n固定的可用接口，也就是说，pz只能够调用ZooAnimal的public接口．\n该接口的access level\n\n只有在运行时期，在该执行点，才能确定调用rotate的object到底是哪个。\nMember Initialization List\n以下的case，必须在构造函数中使用初始化列表\n\n初始化引用数据成员\n初始化const数据成员\n其base class subobject或者class member data需要调用非默认构造函数（构造函数中有参数）\n\n最后一种情况，如果不在初始化列表中初始化，程序的编译和执行都没问题，但效率确很低\nclass Word {\n  String _name;\n  int _cnt;\npublic:\n// not wrong, just naive ...\n  Word() {\n    _name = 0;\n    _cnt = 0;\n  }\n};\n\n这个构造函数首先默认初始化了_name,然后又调用了赋值运算，将初始化的值覆盖。这个赋值运算的过程中，创建并析构了一个临时的String 对象。\nHere is the likely internal transformation of this constructor:\n// Pseudo C++ Code\nWord::Word( /* this pointer goes here */ )\n{\n// invoke default String constructor\n_name.String::String();\n// generate temporary\nString temp = String( 0 );\n// memberwise copy _name\n_name.String::operator=( temp );\n// destroy temporary\ntemp.String::~String();\n_cnt = 0;\n}\n\n更有效率的构造函数如下\n// preferred implementation\nWord::Word : _name( 0 )\n{\n_cnt = 0;\n}\n\nThis expands to something like this:\n// Pseudo C++ Code\nWord::Word( /* this pointer goes here */ )\n{\n// invoke String( int ) constructor\n_name.String::String( 0 );\n_cnt = 0;\n}\n\nThis pitfall, by the way, is most likely to occur in template code of this form:\ntemplate \nfoo::foo( type t )\n{\n// may or may not be a good idea\n// depending on the actual type of type\n_t = t;\n}\n\n编译器遍历初始化列表，根据成员声明的顺序，将其插入到构造函数中的合适位置处。并且初始化列表的代码，在explicit user code之前。\n假设代码如下\nclass X {\n  int i;\n  int j;\npublic:\n  // oops! do you see the problem?\n  X( int val ): j( val ), i( j ){}\n  ...\n};\n\n编译器应该对这种错误使用给个warning,但目前为止，只有g++编译器这样做了。\n正确的初始化方式应该如下\n// preferred idiom\nX::X( int val )\n: j( val )\n{\ni = j;\n}\n\nAnother common question is whether you can invoke a member function to initialize a member, such as\n// is the invocation of X::xfoo() ok?\nX::X( int val ): i( xfoo( val )),j( val )\n{}\n\nxfoo()是X的一个函数成员。可以是可以，但还是要看xfoo()函数对object完整性的依赖度。\n如果将xfoo()放在构造函数体中，而不是在初始化列表中，可以确保在xfoo()被调用时，object对象是完整的\n最后，如下的调用成员函数来初始化基类，是否合理？\n// is the invocation of FooBar::fval() ok?\nclass FooBar : public X {\nint _fval;\npublic:\n  int fval() { return _fval; }\n  FooBar( int val ): _fval( val ),X( fval() ){}\n...\n};\n\n其拓展可能如下\n// Pseudo C++ Code\nFooBar::FooBar( /* this pointer goes here */ )\n{\n// Oops: definitely not a good idea\nX::X( this, this->fval() );\n_fval = val;\n};\n\nIn summary, the compiler iterates over and possibly reorders the initialization list to reflect the declaration order of the members. It inserts the code within the body of the constructor prior to any explicit user code.另外，基类的初始化在派生类之前。\n"},"posts/c&c++/inside the c++ object model/Chapter 2.

The Semantics of Constructors","keywords":"","body":"Default Constructor 的建构操作\n\n以上代码段中，编译器会给class Foo创建默认构造函数，将其data member都初始化为0么？答案是no\n编译器会在需要的时候创建默认构造函数，并且这个默认构造函数只做编译器必要做的事情，比如实现virtual机制，调用基类的默认构造函数，调用data member的默认构造函数，如果这些基类，data member的默认构造函数是nontrivial的话。 否则编译器不会合成出默认构造函数，或者说合成出trivial 默认构造函数，其中什么也不做\n如果想让上面这段代码正确工作，class Foo的设计者必须自己提供一个默认构造函数，将其data member初始化。\n那么什么情况才是编译器认为需要的时候？（如果类的设计者没有提供任何构造函数（不包括拷贝构造函数），编译器会在需要的时候创建默认构造函数，这个函数是nontrivial的，其中会有必须执行的操作。 如果类的设计者已经提供了构造函数（默认的或者非默认的，同样不包括拷贝构造），编译器也可能会拓展其中的操作，如果这些拓展操作被认为是必要的话。）\n编译器认为需要合成nontrivial default constructor情况一\n其data member带有默认构造函数，这个构造函数要么是类的设计者声明的，要么是编译器默认创建的nontrivial构造函数。编译器会为此类合成默认构造函数。不过这个合成操作只有在constructor真正需要被调用时才会发生。\n于是出现了一个有趣的问题，在C++各个不同的编译模块中，编译器如何避免合成出多个default constructor呢？解决方法是把合成的default constructor、copy constructor、destructor、assignment copy operator都以inline方式完成。如果函数太复杂，不适合做成inline，就会合成出一个explicit non-inline static实体\n\n被合成的Bar default constructor内含必要的代码，能够调用class Foo的default constructor来处理member object Bar::foo，但它并不产生任何码来初始化Bar::str,是的，将Bar::foo初始化是编译器的责任，将Bar::str初始化则是程序员的责任。被合成出来的默认构造函数可能像这样：\ninline Bar::Bar(){\n    foo.Foo::Foo();\n}\n\n如果需要Bar::str也被正确初始化，程序员需要提供如下的默认构造函数：\nBar::Bar(){\n    str=0;\n}\n\n这时候，编译器会对已经存在的构造函数进行拓展，拓展后的代码如下\nBar::Bar(){\n    foo.Foo::Foo();\n    str=0;\n}\n\n拓展的代码会在用户代码之前调用必要的构造函数。\n如果有多个class member objects都要求constructor初始化操作，将如何呢？c++语言要求以member objects在class中的声明次序来调用各个conuctors。这一点由编译器完成，它为每一个constructor安插程序代码，以“member声明次序”调用每一个member所关联的default constructors.这些代码将被安插在explicit user code之前。举个例子，假设我们有以下三个classes：\n\n以及一个class Snow_White:\n\n如果Snow_White没有定义default constructor，就会有一个nontrivial constructor被合成出来，依序调用Dopey,Sneezy,Bashful的default constructors\n然而如果定义了下面这样的default constructor：\nSnow_White::Snow_White():sneezy(1024){\n mumbel=2048;\n}\n\n会被拓展成\nSnow_White::Snow_White():snzzey(1024){\n    dopey.Dopey::Dopey();\n    sneezy.Sneezy::Sneezy(1024);\n    bashful.Bashful::Bashful();\n    mumbel=2048;\n}\n\n编译器认为需要合成nontrivial default constructor情况二\n其base class带有default constuctor,这个构造函数要么是类的设计者声明的，要么是编译器默认创建的nontrivial构造函数\n类似的道理，如果一个没有任何constructors（不包括拷贝构造函数）的class派生自一个带有default constructor 的 base class，那么这个derived class的default constructor会被视为nontrivial，并因此需要被合成出来。它将调用上一层base classes的default constructor（根据它们的声明次序）\n如果设计者提供多个constructors（不包括拷贝构造函数），但其中都没有default constructor呢？编译器会扩张现有的每一个constructors，将必要的代码加进去·它不会合成一个新的default constructor，这是因为其它由user所提供的constructors存在的缘故。\n如果同时亦存在着带有default constructors的member class objects，那些default constructor也会被调用,在所有base class default constructors都被调用之后·\n情况三\n带有virtual function,这个virtual function或者是本class 声明的，或者是继承的\n为了支持virtual function机制，编译器会为每个带有virtual function的类创建一个虚函数表，其中包含指向其虚函数的指针。同时，每个类的对象中设置指向该表的指针。代码中通过基类的指针或引用调用虚函数的操作，会被编译器改写成通过访问虚函数表中的指针调用具体某个派生类的虚函数的操作。比如pd->vfunc()被改写成(*pd->vptr[1])(pd),1是vfunc虚函数在虚函数表中的索引。\n正是因为有这些操作要做，如果没有构造函数，编译器需要合成默认构造函数做这些操作。如果有构造函数，需要对已有的构造函数做拓展。\n情况四\n带有virtual base class。同带有virtual function一样的道理，都需要为virtual机制的实现提供必要的操作。\nVirtual base class的实现法在不同的编译器之间有极大的差异。然而，每一种实现法的共通点在于必须使virtual base class在其每一个derived class object中的位置，能够于执行期准备妥当。例如下面这段程序代码中：\n\n因为这里需要支持virtual base class,编译器无法在编译期决议出X::i的实际偏移位置，因为不能确定pa的实际类型。\n如果X不是被虚拟继承的，则这里的调用操作可以在编译期被决议到具体的地址。\n编译器必须改变pa->i代码，使得对X::i的决议可以延迟至执行期才决定下来。原先cfront的做法是靠在派生类中，对每个虚基类，存储一个指向该基类的指针·所有“经由reference或\npointer来存取一个virtual base class”的操作都可以通过相关指针完成。在我的例子中，可以被改写如下，以符合这样的实现策略:\nvoid foo(const A * pa){\n    pa->_vbcX->i = 1024;\n}\n\n以上便是编译器需要合成default constructor的四种情况。\n至于没有存在这四种情况而又没有声明任何constructor的classes，我们说它们拥有的是implicit trivial default constructors，它们实际上并不会被合成出来。\nCopy Constructor的建构操作\n有三种情况，会以一个object的内容作为另一个object的初值\n\nA x = b;\n以一个object作为参数传入函数\n函数返回一个object\n\n如果class提供了一个copy contructor, 如下\nA::A(const A& a);\nB::B(const B& b, int y=0);\n\n在大部分情况下，一个class object以另一个同类object作为初值时，copy constructor会被调用\n如果class没有提供相应的copy constructor, 编译器会合成出默认的拷贝构造函数，这个拷贝构造函数，要么是nontrivial的，要么的trivial的。当然，如果是trivial的，实际上这个拷贝构造函数并没有被真正合成出来。 trivial是指class的拷贝可以bitwise copy，也就是逐位拷贝完成。\n如果一个类中有virtual函数，继承virtual基类，则不能逐位拷贝，合成出的拷贝构造函数要实现virtual机制的支持。\n如果一个类中有class data member提供了拷贝构造函数，或者base class提供了拷贝构造函数，这些拷贝构造函数，可以是类设计者提供的，也可以是编译器合成的nontrivial 拷贝构造函数，这时候，该类也不具备bitwise copy semantics，编译器合成出的拷贝构造函数中需要调用基类或者 class data member的拷贝构造函数。\n\n拷贝构造函数处理virtual function\n\n对于virtual函数的支持，假设有如下两个类：\n\n\nZooAnimal class object以另一个ZooAnimal class object作为初值，或Bear class object以另一个Bear class object作为初值，都可以直接靠\"bitwise copy semantics”完成。因为其vptr都指向同一个虚函数表。\n而以一个derived class object初始化一个base class object时，不能将derived class object的vptr直接拷贝给base class object, 否则下段代码中，调用draw(franny),本来应该调用ZooAnimal::draw(),因为直接拷贝的vptr,franny中的vptr指向了Bear类的虚函数表，变成调用了Bear::draw();\nvoid draw(ZooAnimal &zoo){zoo.draw();}\nvoid foo(){\n    Bear yogi;\n    ZooAnimal franny = yogi;\n    draw(yogi); //调用Bear::draw();\n    draw(franny); //调用Bear::draw();\n}\n\n所以，拷贝构造函数中，需要对vptr进行设置，而不能直接拷贝。这由编译器完成。\n\n拷贝构造函数处理virtual base class\n\nVirtual base class的存在需要特别处理。一个class object如果以另一个object作为初值，而后者有一个virtual base class subobject，那么也会使\"bitwise copy semantics\"失效。\n每一个编译器对于虚拟继承的支持承诺，都表示必须derived class object中的virtual base class subobject位置,在执行期就准备妥当。维护\"位置的完整性\"是编译器的责任.\n“Bitwise copy semantics\"可能会破坏这个位置，所以编译\n器必须在它自己合成出来的copy constructor中做出仲裁。\n如下\n\n编译器所产生的代码（调用ZooAnimal的default constructor、将Raccoon的vptr初始化，并定位出Raccoon中的ZooAnimal subobject）被安插在两个Raccoon constructors之内，成为其先头部队·\n如果以一个Raccoon object初始化另一个Raccoon object，bitwise copy是可以的，但如果一个 class object以其derived class object作为初值，比如现在又有一个RedPanda class,如下\n\n以一个RedPanda object初始化一个Raccoon object,在这种情况下，为了完成正确的Raccoon object初值设定，编译器必须合成一个copy constructor，安插一些码以设定virtual base class pointer/offset的初值（或只是简单地确定它没有被抹消）\n而如果是这样调用\nRaccoon *ptr;\nRedPanda panda = *ptr\n\n这时候，编译器无法知道是否\"bitwise copy semantics”是否还保持着，因为它无法知道（没有流程分析）Raccoon指针是否指向一个真正的Raccoon object，或是指向一个derived class object. 注意，上述代码如果不对 Raccoon 指针做类型转换的话，应该会报错的。隐式转换只在从派生类转换为基类时发生，基类转换为派生类需要显示转换。\nProgram Transformation Semantics\n已知下面程序片段\n#include \"X.h\"\n\nX foo(){\n    X xx;\n    //...\n    return xx;\n}\n\n一个程序员可能会假设， \n\nfoo()函数的每次调用，都会创建xx local object,并且以传值的方式拷贝返回。\n如果X定义了拷贝构造函数，则每次调用foo()时，都会调用X的拷贝构造函数\n\n然而，1的真实性取决于类X的定义。2在某种程度上也依赖于类X的定义，但主要取决于C++编译器提供的优化程度。为了颠覆这些观点，甚至可以断言，在高质量的C++编译器实现中，这两点都不成立\n如下代码，\nX x0;\nvoid foo_bar() {\nX x1( x0 );\nX x2 = x0;\nX x3 = x( x0 );\n// ...\n}\n\nThe required program transformation is two-fold:\n\nEach definition is rewritten with the initialization stripped out.\nAn invocation of the class copy constructor is inserted.\n\n这里的定义是指的占用内存的行为，而不是调用了默认构造函数。\nFor example, foo_bar() might look as follows after this straightforward, two-fold transformation:\n// Possible program transformation\n// Pseudo C++ Code\nvoid foo_bar() {\nX x1;\nX x2;\nX x3;\n// compiler inserted invocations\n// of copy constructor for X\nx1.X::X( x0 );\nx2.X::X( x0 );\nx3.X::X( x0 );\n// ...\n}\n\nwhere the callx1.X::X( x0 );represents a call of the copy constructor\nX::X( const X& xx );\nArgument Initialization\n假设我们有如下代码\nvoid foo( X x0 );\n\nX xx;\n// ...\nfoo( xx );\n\nxx 是怎么作为参数传递给foo函数的？一种方式是在foo函数栈外初始化好x0参数，然后在foo中直接引用这个x0,转换的伪代码如下：\nX __temp; //伪定义操作，只分配内存\n__temp.X::X(xx); //调用拷贝初始化\nfoo(__temp); //注意这里foo被转换为void foo(X& x0);\n\n这个__temp会在foo函数返回后调用析构函数销毁。\n另一种方式是在foo函数栈内调用拷贝构造函数创建x0,并在foo函数返回前销毁创建的x0.\n当然，这种情况，foo也会被转换成 void foo(X& x); 其转换的伪代码如下\nvoid foo(X& x){\n    X x0; //伪定义操作，只分配内存\n    x0.X::X(x);\n    //....\n    X0.X::~X();\n    return;\n}\n\n之前了解到的函数栈的参数和返回值的传递，其被调函数的参数，都是在调用函数栈中构建的，当然，那些讲解都是一builtin type为例。\n函数参数对象的传递，如果参数类型不是引用类型，都是需要调用拷贝构造函数的。\nReturn Value Initialization\n下面一段代码中，bar函数的返回值X是如何被xx拷贝初始化的呢？\nX bar()\n{\nX xx;\n// process xx ...\nreturn xx;\n}\n\n\n首先添加一个引用，引用到返回值。也就是需要在函数中知道返回对象所在的地址。\n在返回之前，给这个地址处的对象做拷贝初始化。\n\n最后的return xx; 就变成了return;\n转换的伪代码如下\n// function transformation to reflect\n// application of copy constructor\n// Pseudo C++ Code\nvoid\nbar( X& __result )\n{\nX xx;\n// compiler generated invocation\n// of default constructor\nxx.X::X();\n// ... process xx\n// compiler generated invocation\n// of copy constructor\n__result.X::X( xx );\nreturn;\n}\n\n也就是说，这一过程，也是要调用拷贝初始化的。\n到目前为止，我们看到一个函数,以如下这种方式被调用时\nX bar(X x0)；\n\nX x1;\n//.....\nbar(x1);\n\n其参数和返回值，都需要调用拷贝构造函数，那么这一过程如何被优化呢？\nOptimization at the User Level\n讲的是狗屁，跳过。\n也就是说，对参数的拷贝构造函数的调用，一般是无法优化掉的。除非函数声明中参数为引用就好了。\nOptimization at the Compiler Level\n假设bar()的函数代码如下\nX bar()\n{\nX xx;\n// ... process xx\nreturn xx;\n}\n\n所谓的NRV优化，就是最后的return xx这个语句，调用X的拷贝构造函数，用函数中的临时对象xx初始化返回值。与其这样，不如一开始就通过对返回值直接在函数中处理好，然后直接return就好了。省去了最后调用拷贝构造函数。\n其伪代码表示如下\nbar( X &__result )\n{\n// default constructor invocation\n// Pseudo C++ Code\n__result.X::X();\n// ... process in __result directly\nreturn;\n}\n\nTo get a sense of the performance gain, consider the following class:\nclass test {\nfriend test foo( double );\npublic:\n    test(){ memset( array, 0, 100*sizeof( double )); }\nprivate:\n    double array[ 100 ];\n};\n\nConsider also the following function, which creates, modifies, and returns a test class object:\ntest foo( double val )\n{\n    test local;\n    local.array[ 0 ] = val;\n    local.array[ 99 ] = val;\n    return local;\n}\n\nand a main() routine that calls the function 10 million times:\nint main()\n{\n    for ( int cnt = 0; cnt \n测试的第一个实例，其test类没有提供拷贝构造函数，同时编译器也没有合成拷贝构造函数，因为该类有bitwise copy semantics。\n而测试的第二个实例，其tests类提供了如下的拷贝构造函数\ninline\ntest::test( const test &t )\n{\nmemcpy( this, &t, sizeof( test ));\n}\n\n如果一个类没有拷贝构造函数，NRV优化便没有被打开，只有一个类有拷贝构造函数，以上的foo函数才会被NRV优化。\n以下是两个编译器的测试结果\n\n可以看到效率的提神是很明显的。\n所以，如果一个类，本身具备bitwise copy semantic的情况下，本身是不需要提供拷贝构造函数的。然而，如果这个类需要大量的拷贝初始化，例如需要以传值的方式传回object,这时候，提供拷贝构造函数可以打开NRV优化，对程序效率的提升是很明显的。\n例如如下的Point3d class \n\n支持以下操作\n\n所有这些操作都符合可被NRV优化的模式\n{\n    Point3d result;\n    //计算result...\n    return result;\n}\n\n这时候应该考虑提供拷贝构造函数\n\n然而不管使用memcpy,或者是memset，都只有在classes不含任何由编译器产生的内部members时才能有效运行。如果Point3d class 声明一个或一个以上的virtual functions，或内含一个virtual base class，那么使用上述函数将会导致那些被编译器产生的内部members的初值被改写。例如，已知下面声明：\n\n总结一下NRV优化\n简单来说，符合以下模式的函数\nX foo(){\n    X xx;\n    //....;\n    return xx;\n}\n\n没有优化前的编译器拓展\n//伪代码\nvoid foo(X& _result){\n    X xx; //定义，只分配内存\n    xx.X::X();\n    //....\n    _result.X(xx); //调用拷贝构造函数\n    return;\n}\n\n如果给X提供了拷贝构造函数，编译器可以选择应用NRV优化。如果编译器应用了NRV优化，便不再在函数栈中创建xx local object,而是直接对返回对象操作。如下，省去了调用拷贝构造函数。\nvoid foo(X& _result){\n    _result.X::X();\n    //....直接操作_result\n    return;\n\n}\n\n"},"posts/c&c++/inside the c++ object model/Chapter 3.

This\n// declaration makes the prior reference illegal.\ntypedef float length;\nlength _val;\n// ...\n};\ntest.cpp:15:15: error: declaration of ‘typedef float Point3d::length’ changes meaning of ‘length’ [-fpermissive]\n    1 | typedef int length;\n因此对于这种情况还是需要defensive programming style,请始终把“nested typedef声明\"放在class的起始处.\nData Member Layout\n如下声明\nclass Point3d {\npublic:\n// ...\nprivate:\n   float x;\n   static List *freeList;\n   float y;\n   static const int chunkSize = 250;\n   float z;\n};\n\nNon static data members在class object中的排列顺序将和其被声明的顺序一样，static data members存储在程序的数据段中。 在上述例子里，每一个3d对象是由三个float组成，按照x,y,z的顺序，从低地址排列到高地址。\nC++Standard要求，在同一个access section 中，members的排列只需符合“较晚出现的members在class object中有较高的地址\"这一条件即可·也就是说，各个members并不一定得连续排列·什么东西可能会介于被声明的members之间呢？members的边界调整（alignment）可能就需要填补一些bytes\n编译器还可能会合成一些内部使用的data members，比如vptr，当前所有的编译器都把它插在每一个“内含virtual function之class\"的object内。vptr会被放在什么位置呢？传统上它被放在所有明确声明的members的最后。不过如今也有一些编译器把vptr放在一个class object的最前端。\nC++Standard秉持先前所说的\"对于布局所持的放任态度\",允许编译器把那些内部产生出来的members自由放在任何位置上，甚至放在那些被程序员声明出来的members之间\nC++ standard也允许编译器将多个access sections之中的data members自由排列，不必在乎它们出现在class声明中的次序。也就是说，下面这样的声明：\nclass Point3d {\npublic:\n// ...\nprivate:\n   float x;\n   static List *freeList;\nprivate:\n   float y;\n   static const int chunkSize = 250;\nprivate:\n   float z;\n};\n\n其class object的大小和组成都和我们先前声明的那个相同，但是members的排列次序则视编译器而定。编译器可以随意把y或z或什么东西放为第一个，不过就我所知，当前没有任何编译器会这么做。\n当前各家编译器都是把一个以上的access sections按照声明的次序存放。\nAccess sections的多寡并不会招来额外负担·例如在一个section中声明8个members，或是在8个sections中总共声明8个members，得到的object大小是一样的。\n以下模板函数可用来判断哪个member 在前，哪个在后。其中data_type1 class_type::* 是指向类数据成员的指针，这个指针的值不是其具体在内存中的地址，而是member在类中的偏移量。\ntemplate\nchar* access_order( data_type1 class_type::* mem1,data_type2 class_type::* mem2 )\n{\n   assert ( mem1 != mem2 );\n   return mem1 \nThis function could then be invoked as follows:\naccess_order( &Point3d::z, &Point3d::y );\nwhere class-type binds to Point3d and data_type1 and data_type2 bind to float.\nAccess of a Data Member\n以下的代码中\nPoint3d origin, *p=&origin;\norigin.x=0.0;\np->x=0.0;\n\n这两种存取方式有何差异？答案视Point3d和x如何声明而定。可能是个static member，也可能是个non static member。Point3d可能是个独立（非派生）的class，也可能是从另一个单一的base class派生而来；虽然可能性不高，但它甚至可能是从多重继承或虚拟继承而来。\n事实上，这两种存取方式唯一存在差异的时候，就是当Point3d有虚基类，而x正是其虚基类的数据成员。\nStatic Data Member\nstatic data members存储在object之外，在程序数据段中只有一份实例，被视为global variable(but with visibility limited to the scope of the class)\n对static member的访问，不管是通过对象的访问，还是对象指针的访问，都是一样的，被解析到位于data segment中的唯一一份实例。这也是唯一的一种，通过对象访问和通过对象指针的访问，完全一样的情况，这里的完全一样，可以被理解为，这两种访问方式，被编译器编译成的程序指令，是完全一样的。\n但如果static member是一个从复杂继承关系中继承而来的member，又当如何？或许它是一个“virtual class的virtual base class”（或其它同等复杂的继承结构）的member也说不定。哦，那无关紧要，程序之中对于static members还是只有唯一一个实体，而其存取路径仍然是那么直接。\n如果static data member的存取是经由函数调用（或其它某些语法）而被存取呢？举个例子，如果我们写：\nfoobar().chunkSize = 250;\n调用foobar()会发生什么事情？cfront的做法是简单地把它丢掉。但C++ standard明确要求foobar()被求值（evaluated），虽然其结果并无用处。\n下面是一种可能的转化：\n// foobar().chunkSize == 250;\n// evaluate expression, discarding result\n(void) foobar();\nPoint3d::chunkSize = 250;\n\nTaking the address of a static data member yields an ordinary pointer of its data type, not a pointer to class member, since the static member is not contained within a class object. For example,\n&Point3d::chunkSize\n\nyields an actual memory address of type\nconst int*\n\n而如果chunkSize不是static data member,则 &Point3d::chunkSize生成的指针类型为\nconst int Point3d::*\n如果有两个classes的static data members同名，那么当它们 都被放在程序的data segment时，就会导致名称冲突。\n编译器的解决方法是暗中对每一个static data member的名称编码，也就是name-mangling。以获得一个独一无二的程序识别代码。有多少个编译器，就有多少种name-mangling做法！通常不外乎是表格啦、语法措辞啦等等。任何name-mangling做法都有两个要点：\n\n一种算法，推导出独一无二的名称。\n万一编译系统（或环境工具）必须和使用者交谈，那些独一无二的名称可以轻易被推导回到原来的名称\n\nNonStatic Data Members\nNonsatic data members直接存放在每一个class object之中。除非经由明确的（explicit）或暗喻的（implicit）class object访问，没有办法直接存取它们。\nthis指针就是一个implicit class object.\nvoid Point3d::translate( const Point3d &pt ) {\nx += pt.x;\ny += pt.y;\nz += pt.z;\n}\n\n这个成员函数会被编译器转换成如下\n// internal augmentation of member function\nvoid  Point3d::translate( Point3d *const this, const Point3d &pt ) {\nthis->x += pt.x;\nthis->y += pt.y;\nthis->z += pt.z;\n}\n\n对每个class object,其non static data member的偏移量（offset）在编译时期即可获知，甚至如果member属于一个virtual base class object（派生自单一或多重继承串链）也是一样·\n因此直接通过对象的访问，都是能在编译时期解析到明确的地址的。\n在通过指针访问的情况下，如果访问的数据成员为virtual base class的成员,因为不确定指针所指向对象的具体类型，而virtual base class 的机制，导致虚基类在不同的derived class 中的偏移是不确定的，需要引入一层间接性。因此对具体地址解析，延迟到了运行时。\n因此对于下面这段程序代码，这两种存取方式唯一的不同，就在于，如果Point3d 是个派生类，其继承结构中有个virtual base class,而x是属于这个virtual base calss的。\nPoint3d origin, *p=&origin;\norigin.x=0.0;\np->x=0.0;\n\n这时候我们不能够说p必然指向哪一种class type（因此我们也就在编译时期不知道这个member真正的offset位置）所以这个存取操作必须延迟至执行期，经由一个额外的间接导引，才能够决.\n如果没有虚拟继承，即使通过指针，虽然指针指向的对象的真正类型也是未知的，但每个元素的偏移量在所有的派生类型中都是确定的，或者说每个subobject在派生类中的偏移量都是确定的，或者说每个subobject中的各成员的偏移量都是确定的。\n比如有如下多重继承\nclass A{};\nclass B{};\nclass C:public A, public B{}\n\n其中B中有成员x;\n如果通过如下方式访问x\nC c;\nB* pb=&c;\npb->x=100;\n\n其中，编译器在B* pb=&c;编译这一步时，会给指针加上base B subobject 在C中的偏移量，指向正确的subobject B. 后续的pb->x,加上x在class B中的偏移量，就解析到正确的地址了。\n在没有虚拟继承的情况下，这些偏移量都是固定的。在有虚基类的情况下，虚基类在不同的派生类中，偏移量不固定，所以这个存取操作必须延迟至执行期，经由一个额外的间接导引，才能够决.\n使用origin,就不会有这些问题，其类型无疑是Point3d，而即使它继承自virtual base class，members的offset位置也在编译时期就固定了，对其地址的解析，在编译时期就可以完成。\nInheritance and the Data Member\n在C++继承模型中，一个class object所表现出来的东西，是其自己的data members加上父类的data members的总和。\n至于derived class members 和base classces members的排列次序并未在C++ Standard中强制指定：理论上编译器可以自由安排之。在大部分编译器的实现中，base class members总是先出现，但属于virtual base class的除外\nInheritance without Polymorphism\nclass Point2d {\npublic:\n  Point2d( float x = 0.0, float y = 0.0 )\n  : _x( x ), _y( y ) {};\n  float x() { return _x; }\n  float y() { return _y; }\n  void x( float newX ) { _x = newX; }\n  void y( float newY ) { _y = newY; }\n  void operator+=( const Point2d& rhs ) {\n    _x += rhs.x();\n    _y += rhs.y();\n  }\n// ... more members\nprotected:\n  float _x, _y;\n};\n\n// inheritance from concrete class\nclass Point3d : public Point2d {\npublic:\n  Point3d( float x = 0.0, float y = 0.0, float z = 0.0 )\n  : Point2d( x, y ), _z( z ) {};\n  float z() { return _z; }\n  void z( float newZ ) { _z = newZ; }\n  void operator+=( const Point3d& rhs ) {\n    Point2d::operator+=( rhs );\n    _z += rhs.z();\n}\n// ... more members\nprotected:\n  float _z;\n};\n\n其class object的布局如下\n\n把一个class分解为两层或更多层，有可能会膨胀所需空间。c++语言保证“出现在derived class中的base class subobject有其完整原样性\"，正是重点所在.\n如下的Concrete对象只占用8个字节，（32位机子上）\nclass Concrete {\npublic:\n// ...\nprivate:\nint val;\nchar c1;\nchar c2;\nchar c3;\n};\n\n而如果分层如下\nclass Concrete1 {\npublic:\n// ...\nprotected:\nint val;\nchar bit1;\n};\nclass Concrete2 : public Concrete1 {\npublic:\n// ...\nprotected:\nchar bit2;\n};\nclass Concrete3 : public Concrete2 {\npublic:\n// ...\nprotected:\nchar bit3;\n};\n\n则最后的Concrete3对象会占用16个字节，而Concrete2对象也会占用12个字节。\n\nAdding Polymorphism\nclass Point2d {\npublic:\n  Point2d( float x = 0.0, float y = 0.0 )\n  : _x( x ), _y( y ) {};\n  // access functions for x & y same as above\n  // invariant across type: not made virtual\n  // add placeholders for z — do nothing ...\n  virtual float z(){ return 0.0 };\n  virtual void z( float ) {}\n  // turn type explicit operations virtual\n  virtual void operator+=( const Point2d& rhs ) {\n   _x += rhs.x(); _y += rhs.y(); \n  }\n  // ... more members\nprotected:\n  float _x, _y;\n};\n\nclass Point3d : public Point2d {\npublic:\n  Point3d( float x = 0.0, float y = 0.0, float z = 0.0 )\n  : Point2d( x, y ), _z( z ) {};\n  float z() { return _z; }\n  void z( float newZ ) { _z = newZ; }\n  void operator+=( const Point2d& rhs ) {\n    Point2d::operator+=( rhs );\n    _z += rhs.z();\n  }\n// ... more members\nprotected:\nfloat _z;\n};\n\n\n导人一个和Point2d有关的virtual table，用来存放它所声明的每一个virtual functions的地址。这个table的元素数目一般而言是被声明的virtual functions的数目，再加上一个或两个slots（用以支持runtime type identification）\n\n在每一个class object中导人一个vptr，提供执行期的链接，使每一个object能够找到相应的virtual table.\n\n加强constructor，使它能够为vptr设定初值，让它指向class所对应的virtual table,这可能意味着在derived class和每一个base class constructor中，重新设定vptr的值。\n\nAugmentation of the destructor to reset the vptr to the associated virtual table of the class. (It is likely to have been set to address the virtual table of the derived class within the destructor of the derived class. Remember, the order of destructor calls is in reverse: derived class and then base class.) An aggressive optimizing compiler can suppress a great many of these assignments.\n\n\n假设vptr被放在对象的末尾，则此时，Point2d 和Point3d的布局如下\n\nMultiple Inheritance\n单一继承提供了一种“自然多态（natural polymorphism）\"形式，是关于classes体系中的base type和derived type之间的转换。下面这样的指定操作：\nP0int3d p3d;\nP0int2d* p=&p3d;\n\n把一个derived class 指针赋值给base class的指针，该操作并不需要编译器去修改地址，它很自然地可以发生，而且提供了最佳执行效率。\n当然如果将vptr放在对象的头部，而如果base class中没有virtual function，把一个derived class 地址转换为 base class的地址，就需要编译器调整了。\n如果是如下的多重继承\nclass Point2d {\npublic:\n// ...\nprotected:\nfloat _x, _y;\n};\n\nclass Point3d: public Point2d {\npublic:\n// ...\nprotected:\nfloat _z;\n};\n\nclass Vertex {\npublic:\n// ...\nprotected:\nVertex *next;\n};\n\nclass Vertex3d : public Point3d, public Vertex {\npublic:\n//...\nprotected:\nfloat mumble;\n};\n\n对一个多重派生对象，将其地址指定给“最左端（也就是第一个）base class的指针\"，情况将和单一继承时相同，因为二者都指向相同的起始地址。需付出的成本只有地址的指定操作而已。至于第二个或后继的base class 的地址指定操作，则需要将地址修改：加上（或减去）介于中间的base class subobject(s)大小，例如：\nVertex3d v3d;\nVertex *pv;\nPoint2d *pp;\nPoint3d *p3d;\n\nthe assignment\npv = &v3d;\n\nrequires a conversion of the form\n// Pseudo C++ Code\npv = (Vertex*)(((char*)&v3d) + sizeof( Point3d ));\n\nwhereas the assignments\npp = &v3d;\np3d = &v3d;\n\nboth simply require a copying of the address. With\nVertex3d *p3d;\nVertex *pv;\n\nthe assignment\npv = p3d;\n\ncannot simply be converted into\npv = (Vertex*)((char*)p3d) + sizeof( Point3d );\n\nsince, if p3d were set to 0, pv would end up with the value sizeof(Point3d). So, for pointers, the internal conversion requires a conditional test:\n// Pseudo C++ Code\npv = p3d\n? (Vertex*)((char*)p3d) + sizeof( Point3d )\n: 0;\n\nConversion of a reference need not defend itself against a possible 0 value, since the reference cannot refer to no object.\nC++ Standard并未要求Vertex3d中的base classes Point3d和Vertex有特定的排列次序。原始的cfront编译器是根据声明次序来排列它们。因此cfront编译器制作出来的Vertex3d对象，将可被视为是一个Point3d subobject（其中又有一个Point2d subobject）加上一个Vertex subobject，最后再加上Vertex3d自己的部分。目前各编译器仍然是以此方式完成多重base classes的布局（但如果加上虚拟继承，就不一样了）。\n\nWhat about access of a data member of a second or subsequent base class? Is there an additional cost? No.The member's location is fixed at compile time. Hence its access is a simple offset the same as under single inheritance regardless of whether it is a pointer, reference, or object through which the member is being accessed.\nVirtual Inheritance\n多重继承会导致某个基类在派生类中存在多个subobject,如下\n\nThe general implementation solution is as follows. A class containing one or more virtual base class subobjects, such as istream, is divided into two regions: an invariant region and a shared region. Data within the invariant region remains at a fixed offset from the start of the object regardless of subsequent derivations. So members within the invariant region can be accessed directly. The shared region represents the virtual base class subobjects. The location of data within the shared region fluctuates with each derivation. So members within the shared region need to be accessed indirectly. What has varied among implementations is the method of indirect access. \n假设如下的虚拟继承链\nclass Point2d {\npublic:\n...\nprotected:\nfloat _x, _y;\n};\nclass Vertex : public virtual Point2d {\npublic:\n...\nprotected:\nVertex *next;\n};\nclass Point3d : public virtual Point2d {\npublic:\n...\nprotected:\nfloat _z;\n};\nclass Vertex3d :\npublic Point3d, public Vertex {\npublic:\n...\nprotected:\nfloat mumble;\n};\n\n\n一般的布局策略是先安排好derived class的不变部分，然后再建立其共享部分·\n而对共享部分的存取，cfront编译器会在每一个derived class object中安插一些指针，每个指针指向一个virtual base class subobject·要存取继承得来的virtual base class  subobject members，可以使用相关指针间接完成·如下：\nvoid Point3d::operator+=( const Point3d &rhs )\n{\n_x += rhs._x;\n_y += rhs._y;\n_z += rhs._z;\n};\n\nunder the cfront strategy, this is transformed internally into\n// Pseudo C++ Code\n__vbcPoint2d->_x += rhs.__vbcPoint2d->_x;\n__vbcPoint2d->_y += rhs.__vbcPoint2d->_y;\n_z += rhs._z;\n\nA conversion between the derived and base class instances, such as\nPoint2d *pv = pv3d;\n\nunder the cfront implementation model becomes\n// Pseudo C++ code\nPoint2d *pv = pv3d ? pv3d->__vbcPoint2d : 0;\n\n另一种实现方式是在virtual function table中存放virtual base class的偏移。\n在新近的sun编译器中，virtual function table可经由正值或负值来索引。如果是正值，很显然就是索引到virtual functions;如果是负值，则是索引到virtual base class offset . 在这样的策略之下，Point3d的operator+=运算符必须被转换为以下形式：\n// Pseudo C++ Code\n(this + __vptr__Point3d[-1])->_x +=(&rhs + rhs.__vptr__Point3d[-1])->_x;\n(this + __vptr__Point3d[-1])->_y +=(&rhs + rhs.__vptr__Point3d[-1])->_y;\n_z += rhs._z;\n\n以上两种布局方式如下\n\n存储指向共享部分的指针\n\n在vtbl中存储共享部分的偏移\n\n注意在virtual继承的情况下，派生类会有自己的vptr\n\n上述每一种方法都是一种实现模型，而不是一种标准．每一种模型都是用来解决“存取shared subobject内的数据（其位置会因每次派生操作而有变化）”所引发的问题，由于对virtual base class的支持带来额外的负担以及高度的复杂性，每一种实现模型多少有点不同，而且我想还会随着时间而进化．\n经由一个class object来存取一个继承而来的virtual base class的member，像这样：\nPoint3d origin;\norigin.x：\n\n可以被优化为一个直接存取操作，就好像一个经由对象调用的virtual function，可以在编译时期被决议（resolved）完成一样· 一个确定的object,其所有的成员，不管是不是继承而来的，是自己的还是父类的，父类是不是虚基类，其成员的位置都是固定的，偏移量在编译期已知。\n一般而言，virtual class最有效的一种运用形式就是：一个抽象的virtual base class，没有任何data members·\nPointer to Data Members\n有如下类\nclass Point3d {\npublic:\nvirtual ~Point3d();\n// ...\nprotected:\nstatic Point3d origin;\nfloat x, y, z;\n};\n\n下面的表达式返回z data member在Point3d对象中的偏移，其类型是float Point3d::*\n&Point3d::z;\n\n如果当前编译器的实现将vptr放在对象的尾部，则上述表达式的值应该是9，也就是实际的偏移值+1，+1的主要目的是为了区分没有指向任何data member的指针，和指向第一个data member的指针。\n而如果表达式为\n&origin.z\n\n则返回的是z在内存中的地址，类型为float*,不再是偏移量。将该结果减去z的偏移量再+1，就是origin在内存中的地址。\n在多重继承下\nstruct Base1 { int val1; };\nstruct Base2 { int val2; };\nstruct Derived : Base1, Base2 { ... };\nvoid func1( int Derived::*dmp, Derived *pd )\n{\n  // expects a derived pointer to member\n  // what if we pass it a base pointer?\n  pd->*dmp;\n}\nvoid func2( Derived *pd )\n{\n  // assigns bmp 1\n  int Base2::*bmp = &Base2::val2;\n  // oops: bmp == 1,\n  // but in Derived, val2 == 5\n  func1( bmp, pd )\n}\n\n这时候，编译器需要将最后的func1调用在内部转换为\n// internal transformation\n// guarding against bmp == 0\nfunc1( bmp ? bmp + sizeof( Base1 ) : 0, pd );\n\n否则，pd->*dmp就会取到Base1::val1的值，而不是Base2::val2\n"},"posts/c&c++/inside the c++ object model/Chapter 4.

For example,\nunsigned int Point3d::object_count()\n{\n    return _object_count;\n}\n\nunder cfront is transformed internally into\n// internal transformaton under cfront\nunsigned int object_count__5Point3dSFv()\n{\n    return _object_count__5Point3d;\n}\n\nwhere SFv indicates it is a static member function with an empty (void) argument list.\n&Point3d::object_count();\n\nyields a value of type\nunsigned int (*)();\n\nnot of type\nunsigned int ( Point3d::* )();\n\nVirtual Member Function\n一个class 的虚函数表中的虚函数包括\n\n这个class定义的虚函数。它可能重写了基类的虚函数\n继承自基类的虚函数，没有被这个class重写\nA pure_virtual_called() library instance that serves as both a placeholder for a pure virtual function and a runtime exception should the instance somehow be invoked\n\nEach virtual function is assigned a fixed index in the virtual table. This index remains associated with the particular virtual function throughout the inheritance hierarchy. In our Point class hierarchy, for example,\nclass Point {\npublic:\n  virtual ~Point();\n  virtual Point& mult( float ) = 0;\n  // ... other operations ...\n  float x() const { return _x; }\n  virtual float y() const { return 0; }\n  virtual float z() const { return 0; }\n  // ...\nprotected:\n  Point( float x = 0.0 );\n  float _x;\n};\n\nthe virtual destructor is likely to be assigned slot 1 and mult() assigned slot 2. (In this case, there is no mult() definition, so the address of the library function pure_virtual_called() is placed within the slot. If that instance should by some accident get invoked, generally it would terminate the program.) y() is assigned slot 3 and z() slot 4.\n当Point2d继承自Point时\nclass Point2d : public Point {\npublic:\n  Point2d( float x = 0.0, float y = 0.0 )\n  : Point( x ), _y( y ) {}\n  ~Point2d();\n  // overridden base class virtual functions\n  Point2d& mult( float );\n  float y() const { return _y; }\n  // ... other operations ...\nprotected:\n  float _y;\n};\n\nThere are three possibilities:\n\nIt can inherit the instance of the virtual function declared within the base class. Literally, the address of that instance is copied into the associated slot in the derived class's virtual table.\nIt can override the instance with one of its own. In this case, the address of its instance is placed within the associated slot.\nIt can introduce a new virtual function not present in the base class. In this case, the virtual table is grown by a slot and the address of the function is placed within that slot.\n\nPoint2d's virtual table addresses its destructor in slot 1 and its instance of mult() in slot 2 (replacing the pure virtual instance). It addresses its instance of y() in slot 3 and retains Point's inherited instance of z() in slot 4.\n最后Point3d继承自Point2d\nclass Point3d: public Point2d {\npublic:\n   Point3d( float x = 0.0,\n   float y = 0.0, float z = 0.0 )\n   : Point2d( x, y ), _z( z ) {}\n   ~Point3d();\n   // overridden base class virtual functions\n   Point3d& mult( float );\n   float z() const { return _z; }\n   // ... other operations ...\nprotected:\n  float _z;\n};\n\ngenerates a virtual table with Point3d's destructor in slot 1 and Point3d's instance of mult() in slot 2. It\nplaces Point2d's inherited instance of y() in slot 3 and Point3d's instance of z() in slot 4.\n以上三个class object以及其virtual table的布局如下，假设编译器将vptr放置在对象尾部\n\n多重继承下的Virtual Function\n// hierarchy to illustrate MI complications\n// of virtual function support\nclass Base1 {\npublic:\n   Base1();\n   virtual ~Base1();\n   virtual void speakClearly();\n   virtual Base1 *clone() const;\nprotected:\n   float data_Base1;\n};\n\nclass Base2 {\npublic:\n   Base2();\n   virtual ~Base2();\n   virtual void mumble();\n   virtual Base2 *clone() const;\nprotected:\n   float data_Base2;\n};\n\nclass Derived : public Base1, public Base2 {\npublic:\n   Derived();\n   virtual ~Derived();\n   virtual Derived *clone() const;\nprotected:\n   float data_Derived;\n};\n\nDerived支持virtual functions的困难度统统落在Base2 subobject身上。有三个问题需要解决，以此例而言分别是(1)virtual destructor（2）被继承下来的Base2::mumble()，（3）一组clone()函数实体. 让我依次解决每一个问题\nvirtual destructor\nFirst, let's assign a Base2 pointer the address of a Derived class object allocated on the heap:\nBase2 *pbase2 = new Derived;\n\nThe address of the new Derived object must be adjusted to address its Base2 subobject. The code to accomplish this is generated at compile time:\n// transformation to support second base class\nDerived *temp = new Derived;\nBase2 *pbase2 = temp ? temp + sizeof( Base1 ) : 0;\n\n如果没有以上的转换，则下面的访问操作会失败\n// ok even if pbase2 assigned Derived object\npbase2->data_Base2;\n\n而当我们需要调用delete 函数对象时\ndelete pbase2;\n\npbase2指针必须再一次被调整，以指向Derived的起始处。\n然而当我们调用delete pbase2时，编译器还能确定pbase2还指向原来的Derived对象中的Base2 subobject么？显然是不能的。此时pbase2也可能就指向一个Base2对象，指针压根不需要调整。\n因此，这个this指针的调整值只能在运行时才能确定。因为只有运行时才知道pbase2指针指向的对象到底什么。\n所以，这个调整值，要存储在对象的某个地方，一种方法是，在虚函数表中，和指向虚函数的指针存储在一起。也就是说，虚函数表中的每个对象不单单是一个指针，还包括一个偏移量，这个偏移量需要在调用时加到this指针上。\nThe virtual function call changed from\n( *pbase2->vptr[1])( pbase2 );\n\ninto\n( *pbase2->vptr[1].faddr)( pbase2 + pbase2->vptr[1].offset );\n\nwhere faddr held the virtual function address and offset held the necessary this pointer adjustment.\n这个做法的缺点是，它相当于连带处罚了所有的virtual function调用操作,不管它们是否需要this指针的调整·我所谓的处罚，包括offset的额外存取及其加法，以及每一个virtual table slot的大小改变。\n另一种方法，是使用所谓的thunk技术，所谓的thunk就是一小段assembly code，其中包括调整this指针和跳转virtual function去执行。\n如果虚函数表中的某个函数在被调用时需要调整this指针，虚函数表中就存储该thunk的指针，否则存储函数的指针即可。\n调整this指针的第二个额外负担就是，由于两种不同的可能：(1)经由derived class（或第一个base class）调用，（2）经由第二个（或其后继）base class调用，同函数在virtual table中可能需要多笔对应的slots·例如：\nBase1 *pbase1 = new Derived;\nBase2 *pbase2 = new Derived;\ndelete pbase1;\ndelete pbase2;\n\n虽然两个delete操作导致相同的Derived destructor被调用，但它们需要两个不同的virtual table slots\n\npbase1 does not require a this pointer adjustment (being leftmost, it already points to the beginning of the Derived class object). Its virtual table slot requires the actual destructor address.\n\npbase2 does require a this pointer adjustment. Its virtual table slot requires the address of the associated thunk.\n\n\n以下应该不准确\n在多重继承之下，一个derived class内含n个virtual tables，n表示其上一层base classes的数目，当然，其每一个base class中要有虚函数，不管这个虚函数是自己的还是继承的。\n\n在单一继承下，不会产生额外的virtual tables.\n\n以上两种情况均不包括虚拟继承。\n以上\n\n\n对于本例Derived class而言，会有两个virtual tables被编译器产生出来：\n\nThe primary instance shared with Base1, its leftmost base class\nA secondary instance associated with Base2, the second base class\n\nThe Derived class object contains a vptr for each associated virtual table. The vptrs are initialized within the constructor(s) through code generated by the compiler.\n\n用以支持“一个class拥有多个virtual tables\"的传统方法是，将每一个tables以外部对象的形式产生出来，并给予独一无二的名称。例如，Derived所关联的两个tables可能有这样的名称：\nvtbl__Derived; // the primary table\nvtbl__Base2__Derived; // the secondary table\n\n于是当你将一个Derived对象地址指定给一个Base1指针或Derived指针时，被处理的virtual table是vtblDerived。而当你将一个Derived对象地址指定给一个Base2指针时，被处理的virtual table是vtblBase2__Derived.\n被继承下来的Base2::mumble()\n通过一个“指向derived class”的指针，调用第二个base class中一个继承而来的virtual function。在此情况下，derived class指针必须再次调整，以指向第二个base class subobject。例如：\nDerived *pder = new Derived;\n// invokes Base2::mumble()\n// pder must be adjusted forward by sizeof( Base1 )\npder->mumble();\n\n可能的转换如下，如果其实现是修改虚函数表中每个slot中的格式的话：\n(*pder->vtbl__Derived[4].faddr)(pder+pder->vtbl__Derived[4].offset)\n\n一组clone()函数实体\n第三种情况发生于一个语言的扩充性质之下：允许一个virtual function的返回值类型有所变化，可能是base type，也可能是publicly derived type。这一点可以通过Derived::clone()函数实体来说明。clone函数的Derived版本传回一个Derived class指针，默默地改写了它的两个base class中的函数实体。当我们通过“指向第二个base”的指针来调用clone时，this指针又需要调整了：\nBase2 *pb2 = new Derived;\n// invokes Derived* Derived::clone()\n// return must be adjusted to address Base2 subobject\nBase2 *pb2_2 = pb2->clone();\n\nThe Derived class instance of clone() is invoked and uses the thunk to readjust pb2 to address the beginning of the Derived class object. Now clone() returns a pointer to a new Derived class object, and the address must be adjusted to point to the Base2 subobject before being assigned to pb2_2.\nSun编译器实现了一种“split functions”的策略，当函数被认为是“small”时：使用相同的算法代码生成两个函数实例。然而，第二个实例在返回指针之前添加必要的偏移量。\n因此，通过Base1或Derived指针调用会调用没有返回值调整的实例，而通过Base2指针调用则会调用另一个实例。\n其他实现略，看不懂\n虚拟继承下的Virtual Function\nclass Point2d {\npublic:\n   Point2d( float = 0.0, float = 0.0 );\n   virtual ~Point2d();\n   virtual void mumble();\n   virtual float z();\n   // ...\nprotected:\n   float _x, _y;\n};\nclass Point3d : public virtual Point2d{\npublic:\n   Point3d( float = 0.0, float = 0.0, float = 0.0 );\n   ~Point3d();\n   float z();\nprotected:\n   float _z;\n};\n\nAlthough Point3d has a single leftmost base class—Point2d—the beginning of Point3d and Point2d is no longer　coincident (as they are under nonvirtual single inheritance). Since the Point2d　and Point3d objects are no longer coincident, conversion between the two also requires a this pointer adjustment. Efforts to eliminate thunks under virtual inheritance in general have proved much more difficult.\n\n这张图中，p3d对象的两个vtbl中，mumble应该是point2d::mumble(). 需要调整this指针的函数有，vptrPoint3d中的Point2d::mumble(),vptrPoint2d中的Point3d::~Point3d(),Point3d::z()\nPointer to Member Function\n取一个non static data member的地址，得到的结果是该member在class object中的偏移再加1·你可以想象它是个不完整的值，它需要被绑定于某个class object的地址上，才能够被存取。\n取一个non static member function的地址，如果该函数是non virtual，则得到的结果是它在内存中真正的地址·然而这个值也是不完全的，它也需要被绑定于某个object的地址上，才能够通过它调用该函数。所有的non static member functions都需要object的地址（以参数this指出）\n一个指向member function的指针，其声明语法如下\ndouble (Point::* pmf)();\n\nThus one writes\ndouble (Point::*coord)() = &Point::x;\n\nto define and initialize a pointer to class member function and writes\ncoord = &Point::y;\n\nto assign a value to it.\n而通过Pointer to member function的指针来调用函数成员，有如下两种方式：\n( origin.*coord )();\n\nor\n( ptr->*coord )();\n\nThese are converted internally by the compiler to, respectively,\n// Pseudo C++ Code\n( coord )( & origin );\n\nand\n// Pseudo C++ Code\n( coord )( ptr );\n\n如果是pointer to static member function,其指针类型就是普通的函数指针。\nSupporting Pointer-to-Virtual-Member Functions\nConsider the following code fragment:\nfloat (Point::*pmf)() = &Point::z;\nPoint *ptr = new Point3d;\n\npmf是指向class member function的指针，但是Point::z却是个虚函数。\nPoint3d实现了该虚函数z();\n如果我们通过ptr调用虚函数\nptr->z();\n\n调用的是Point3d::z();\n如果我们通过pmf调用虚函数\n( ptr->*pmf)();\n\n调用的还是Point3d::z(),也就是说，pointer to class member function 依然对virtual机制有效，这是如何实现的？\n对一个non virtual function取地址，获取的是其在内存中的地址，对一个virtual function取地址，获取的是其在virtual table中的index\n假设Point定义如下\nclass Point\n{\npublic:\nvirtual ~Point();\nfloat x();\nfloat y();\nvirtual float z();\n// ...\n};\n\nThen taking the address of the destructor\n&Point::~Point;\n\nyields 1. Taking the address of either x() or y()\n&Point::x;\n&Point::y;\n\nyields their actual memory locations, since they are not virtual. Taking the address of z()\n&Point::z;\n\nyields 2. \nThe invocation of z() through pmf, then, becomes translated internally into a compile-time expression of the following general form:\n( * ptr->vptr[ (int)pmf ])( ptr );\n\npmf的定义如下\nfloat (pointer::*pmf)();\n\n也就是对于指向class member function 指针，不管其指向的是virtual,还是non virtual，指针的类型都是一样的。\n也可以将pmf指向Point::x()\npmf=&Point::x()\n\n这样其指向的就不是virtual function了。\n而对于virtual function,和non virtual function,其调用方式是不一样的，那么编译器如何区分这两种值呢？\nIn the pre-Release 2.0 cfront implementation, it used the following trick:\n((( int ) pmf ) & ~127 )\n? // non-virtual invocation\n( *pmf )( ptr )\n: // virtual invocation\n( * ptr->vptr[ (int) pmf ])( ptr );\n\nOf course, this implementation assumes a limit of 128 virtual functions to an inheritance graph. This is not desirable, but in practice it has proved viable. The introduction of multiple inheritance, however, requires a more general implementation scheme and provides an opportunity to remove the limit on the number of virtual functions.\nPointer-to-Member Functions under 多重继承\nFor pointers to member function to support both multiple and virtual inheritances, Stroustrup designed the following aggregate structure\n// fully general structure to support\n// pointer to member functions under MI\nstruct __mptr {\nint delta;\nint index;\nunion {\nptrtofunc faddr;\nint v_offset;\n};\n};\n\n如果member function为virtual function, index为在virtual function table中的索引，如果不是virtual function,则faddr为其在内存中的地址。而此时，index为-1.\ndelta为this指针需要加上的偏移。 v_offset member holds the location of the vptr of a virtual (or second or subsequent) base class\n如果使用这种方法，则\n( ptr->*pmf )()\n\nbecomes\n( pmf.index vptr[ pmf.index ])( ptr );\n\n而这些字段只在多重继承和虚拟继承存在的情况下，才有必要存在。\nso many compilers provide multiple internal pointer-to-member-function representations based on the characteristics of the class. Microsoft, for example, provides three flavors:\n\nA single inheritance instance (which simply holds either the vcall thunk or function address,vcall thunk only necessary for virtual function)\nA multiple inheritance instance (which holds the faddr and delta members)\nA virtual inheritance instance (which holds four members!)\n\nInline Function\n假设有如下的Point类的友元函数\nclass Point {\nfriend Point operator+( const Point&, const Point& );\n...\n};\n\nPoint operator+( const Point &lhs, const Point &rhs )\n{\nPoint new_pt;\nnew_pt._x = lhs._x + rhs._x;\nnew_pt._y = lhs._y + rhs._y;\nreturn new_pt;\n}\n\n理论上，一个更好的实现，是提供inline get 和set _x,_y数据成员的函数。\n// void Point::x( float new_x ) { _x = new_x; }\n// float Point::x() { return _x; }\nnew_pt.x( lhs.x() + rhs.x() );\n\n通过get和set成员函数，对数据的访问提供了封装。日后如果data member有改动，这种封装将改动的影响降低。 同时，因为将get和set声明为inline，we maintain the performance efficiency of direct member access。最后，这种使用方式，operator+()不再需要被声明为友元函数。\n但inline只是一个请求，编译器实际在处理时，有可能并不inline. 编译器会根据函数的复杂度决定这个函数是否inlineable. cfront有一套复杂的测试法，通常是用来计算assignments、function calls、virtual function calls等操作的次数，每个表达式（expression）种类有一个权值，而inline函数的复杂度就以这些操作的总和来决定\n一般而言，处理一个inline函数，有两个阶段：\n\n分析函数定义，判断函数是否可inline. 如果被判断不可成为inline，它会被转为一个static函数，并在“被编译模块\"内产生对应的函数定义。In an environment supporting separately compiled modules, there is little alternative for the compiler. Ideally, a linker cleans up the multiple instances generated. \nThe actual inline expansion of the function at a point of call. This involves argument evaluation and management of temporaries.\n\nFormal Argument（形式参数）\n在inline函数拓展时，其形式参数会被其实际参数替代。\n但是如果实际参数有side effect, 需要引入temporary object,防止实际参数被多次计算。\n而如果实际参数是常量，we'd like it to be evaluated prior to its substitution，subsequent constant folding may also be performed\nIf it is neither a constant expression nor an\nexpression with side effects, a straight substitution of each actual argument with the associated formal argument is carried out.\nFor example, say we have the following simple inline function:\ninline int\nmin( int i, int j )\n{\nreturn i \nand the following three invocations of the inline function:\ninline  int bar()\n{\nint minval;\nint val1 = 1024;\nint val2 = 2048;\n/*(1)*/minval = min( val1, val2 );\n/*(2)*/minval = min( 1024, 2048 );\n/*(3)*/minval = min( foo(), bar()+1 );\nreturn minval;\n}\n\nThe inline expansion of the line marked (1) is a straightforward substitution:\n//(1) simple argument substitution\nminval = val1 \nwhile the inline expansion of the line marked (2) involves constant folding:\n//(2) constant folding following substitution\nminval = 1024;\n\nFinally, the inline expansion of the line marked (3) involves argument side effects and the introduction of a temporary object in order to avoid multiple evaluations:\n//(3) side-effects and introduction of temporary\nint t1;\nint t2;\nminval =\n( t1 = foo() ), ( t2 = bar() + 1 ),\nt1 \nLocal Variables\n如果我们将上述inline函数的定义改为如下\ninline int\nmin( int i, int j )\n{\nint minval = i \n也就是在其中添加了局部变量。\n而对min函数的调用如下\n{\nint local_var;\nint minval;\n// ...\nminval = min( val1, val2 );\n}\n\n这时候，可能的拓展如下\n{\nint local_var;\nint minval;\n// mangled inline local variable\nint __min_lv_minval;\n\nminval =( __min_lv_minval = val1 \n(in theory, in this example the local inline variable can be optimized out and the value directly computed on minval )\nIn general, each local variable within the inline function must be introduced into the enclosing block of the call as a uniquely named variable. \nIf the inline function is expanded multiple times within one expression, each expansion is likely to require its own set of the local variables. \nIf the inline function is expanded multiple\ntimes in discrete statements, however, a single set of the local variables can probably be reused across the multiple expansions.\n结合之前所讲的，形式参数的替代，如果实际参数有side effect,会引入临时变量。 这样，在inline函数拓展时，尤其是，如果是 expanded multiple times within a single expression 的情况下，可能会生成很多临时变量。\nFor example, the following call\nminval = min( val1, val2 ) + min( foo(), foo()+1 );\n\nmight be expanded as follows:\n// generated temps for local variable\nint __min_lv_minval__00;\nint __min_lv_minval__01;\n// generated temps to hold side-effects\nint t1;\nint t2;\nminval =\n(( __min_lv_minval__00 =\nval1 \n"},"posts/c&c++/inside the c++ object model/Chapter 5.

Lifting up data members shared among several derived types can be a legitimate design choice.\nPresence of a Pure Virtual Desctructor\nC++新手常常很惊讶地发现，一个人竟然可以定义和调用（invoke）一个pure virtual  function：不过它只能被静态地调用（invoked statically），不能经由虚拟机制调用，例如，你可以合法地写下这段码：\n// ok: definition of pure virtual function\n// but may only be invoked statically ...\ninline void Abstract_base::interface()\n{\n    // ...\n}\ninline void Concrete_derived::interface()\n{\n    // ok: static invocation\n    Abstract_base::interface();\n    // ...\n}\n\n要不要这样做，全由class设计者决定．唯一的例外就是pure virtual destructor:class设计者一定得定义它，为什么？因为每一个derived class destructor会被编译器加以扩展，以静态调用的方式调用其每一个base class 的destructor.因此，只要缺乏任何一个base class destructors的定义，就会导致链接失败． 即使基类的虚析构函数被定义为纯虚函数，也需要提供析构函数的定义。\n又有人可能会说了，如果一个类的虚析构函数忘记定义了，难道编译器不能合成一个定义么？\n因为分离编译的缘故，编译器只有在连接期才可能知道一个类的虚析构函数只有声明没有定义，当然，这时候，也许可以实现一个机制，重新激活编译器，给其一个指令，合成析构函数。但是，应该没有编译器会这么做。 \n最好的设计选择是不要将虚析构函数定义为pure virtual.\n当然，如果一个类没有声明析构函数，编译器会合成一个析构函数，这个析构函数什么也不做，也不是virtual的。\nPresence of a Virtual Specification\n将Abstract_base::mumble() 声明为virtual 并不是一个好的设计。 \n因为显然，这个函数并不是 type dependent, 不太可能在派生类中被重写。并且，这个函数的实现是inline的，而又被声明为virtual,如果一个inline函数被声明为virtual,其inline机制就失效了。 这样，本来因inline而带来的优化就没有了，编译器在遇到mumble函数调用的时候，本来可以原地拓展的，现在却需要走虚函数调用机制。\nPresence of const within a Virtual Specification\nAbstract_base::interface()这个pure virtual函数被声明为const了，\n因为虚函数通常是type dependent,意味着派生类很可能要重写该函数。如果将虚函数声明为const，意味着派生类中也需要为const。\n如果一个成员函数没有被声明为const, 在const对象调用该成员时需要做 const cast.\n而如果一个成员函数被声明为const，实际实现时，比如在派生类中实现时，发现还是需要修改对象成员，这时候只能将const去掉。\n所以在基类中声明的虚函数，最好不要声明为const\nA Reconsidered Class Declaration\n综上所述，以下的Abstract_base的声明应该更合理\nclass Abstract_base {\npublic:\n    virtual ~Abstract_base();\n    virtual void interface() = 0;\n    const char* mumble () const { return _mumble; }\nprotected:\n    Abstract_base( char *pc = 0 );\n    char *_mumble;\n};\n\nObject Construction without Inheritance\n考虑如下一段代码\n(1) Point global;\n(2)\n(3) Point foobar()\n(4) {\n(5)     Point local;\n(6)     Point *heap = new Point;\n(7)     *heap = local;\n(8)     // ... stuff ...\n(9)     delete heap;\n(10)    return local;\n(11) }\nline 1,5,6 代表3个object 变量的创建，global,local,heap memory allocation.\nline 7 将一个object赋值给另一个object\nline 10 将返回值初始化\nline 9 explicitly deletes the heap object\nobject的生命周期由运行时决定。 The local object's lifetime extends from its definition at line 5 through line 10.\nThe global object's lifetime extends for the entire program execution. \nThe lifetime of an object allocated on the heap extends from the point of its allocation using operator new through application of operator delete.\n假设Point的声明如下\ntypedef struct\n{\n    float x, y, z;\n} Point;\n\n和C是完全兼容的，这种声明，在C++中被叫做Plain Ol' Data\nC++在编译这个类时，会发生什么？理论上，编译器会在内部给这个类声明trivial default constructor, trivial destructor, trivial copy constructor, and trivial copy assignment operator 。\n而实际上，编译器在分析了这个类之后，将其tag为Plain Ol' Data.\n当编译器遇到如下的定义时\n(1) Point global;\n\n理论上，编译器会定义 Point's trivial constructor and destructor， 并且，在program startup代码中需要调用constructor ，在exit代码中，需要调用destructor。\n事实上，这些trivial constructor and destructor 既没有被定义出来，也没有被调用。 the program behaves exactly as it would in C.\n只有一点例外，在c语言中，未初始化的全局变量是被放在bss（Block Started by Symbol）段的，bss段在可执行文件中只有符号，其数据是在被加载时零初始化的。\n而在c++中，因为构造函数的存在，全局变量都被认为是初始化过了的，不使用bss段，所有的全局变量都被放在已初始化过的全局变量数据段中，当然其中的数据都是零值初始化的。\nfoobar()函数中的local Point object,没有被初始化，因为构造函数是trivial的，不会做任何事。这样，line 7中对其的直接使用，很可能是个bug\nLine 6的\n(6) Point *heap = new Point;\n\nis transformed into a call of the library instance of operator new\nPoint *heap = __new( sizeof( Point ));\n\nAgain, there is no default constructor applied to the Point object returned by the call to operator new. The assignment to this object on the next line would solve this problem if local were properly initialized:\n(7) *heap = local;\n\nThis assignment should generate a compiler warning of the general form\nwarning, line 7: local is used before being initialized.\n\n理论上， *heap = local;编译器在遇到这个语句时，会定义拷贝赋值运算符并调用。而实际上，因为是Plain Ol' Data，the assignment remains a bitwise copy exactly as it is in C.\n(9) delete heap;\n\nis transformed into a call of the library instance of operator delete\n__delete( heap );\n\nAgain, conceptually, this triggers the generation of the trivial destructor for Point. But, as we've seen, the destructor, in practice, is neither generated nor invoked. \nFinally, the return of local by value conceptually triggers the definition of the trivial copy constructor, which is then invoked。In practice, the return remains a simple bitwise copy operation of Plain Ol' Data.\nAbstract Data Type\n第二个关于Point的声明如下\nclass Point {\npublic:\n    Point( float x = 0.0, float y = 0.0, float z = 0.0 )\n    : _x( x ), _y( y ), _z( z ) {}\n    // no copy constructor, copy assignment operator\n    // or destructor defined ...\n    // ...\nprivate:\n    float _x, _y, _z;\n};\n\n提供了对数据的封装，使用ADT设计范式。没有任何virtual函数。\n这个类对象的大小同之前一样，只有三个数据成员的大小，其public，private access label不会占用对象任何空间，member function也一样。\n我们也没有提供拷贝构造函数，拷贝赋值运算符，default bitwise copy semantics are sufficient. 我们也不会提供析构函数， the default program management of memory is sufficient.\nThe definition of a global instance\nPoint global; // apply Point::Point( 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 );\n\n编译器会在程序开始时，给global调用默认构造函数初始化。\n如果class的初始化的值都是constant values, 显示初始化列表的使用更高效，如下，local1使用显示初始化列表初始化。而local2使用默认构造函数初始化。\nvoid mumble()\n{\n    Point1 local1 = { 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 };\n    Point2 local2(1.0,1.0,1.0); \n    // 默认构造函数的 inline expansion 如下\n    local2._x = 1.0;\n    local2._y = 1.0;\n    local2._z = 1.0;\n\n    // the explicit initialization is slightly faster\n}\n\nlocal1的初始化比local2更高效， 因为初始化列表中的常量，在mumble函数栈被设置时，就被放置在mumble函数栈中，local1对应的空间中了。\n而local2使用默认构造函数初始化，默认构造函数被拓展成一条条需要执行的赋值语句\n显示初始化列表初始化也有缺点：\n\n只有在所有的class members都是public时，才能使用\n在初始化列表中只能放置常量表达式(those able to be evaluated at compile time)\n\nThe definition of the local Point object\n{\n    Point local;\n    // ...\n}\n\nis now followed by the inline expansion of the Point defaul constructor:\n{\n  // inline expansion of default constructor\n  Point local;\n  local._x = 0.0; local._y = 0.0; local._z = 0.0;\n  // ...\n}\n\nThe allocation of the Point object on the heap on line 6\n(6) Point *heap = new Point;\n\nnow includes a conditional invocation of the Point  default  constructor\n// Pseudo C++ Code\nPoint *heap = __new( sizeof( Point ));\nif ( heap != 0 )\n    heap->Point::Point();\n\nwhich is then inline expanded. \nThe assignment of the local object to the object pointed to by heap\n(7) *heap = local;\n\nremains a simple bitwise copy, as does the return of the local object by value :\n(10) return local;\n\nThe deletion of the object addressed by heap\n(9) delete heap;\n\ndoes not result in a destructor call, since we did not explicitly provide an instance.\nConceptually, our Point class has an associated default copy constructor, copy assignment operator, and destructor. These, however, are trivial and are not in practice actually generated by the compiler.\nPreparing for Inheritance\n下面的第三个Point的声明，提供了面向对象的特性，其中有virtual函数，这个virtual机制主要是针对z data member的存取的\nclass Point {\npublic:\n  Point( float x = 0.0, float y = 0.0 ): _x( x ), _y( y ) {}\n  // no destructor, copy constructor, or\n  // copy  assignment operator defined ...\n  virtual float z();\n  // ...\nprotected:\n    float _x, _y;\n};\n\n这里，我们依然没有定义 copy constructor, copy assignment operator, or destructor。 \nAll our members are stored by value and are therefore well behaved on a program level under the default semantics. (Some people would argue that the introduction of a virtual function should always be accompanied by the declaration of a virtual destructor. But doing that would buy us nothing in this case.) 这里存疑哈，trivail desctructor是nonvirtual的，如果派生类确实需要在desctrctor中执行一些操作，而 delete p将调用 Point的trivial destructor，这是不对的\n首先virtual函数的引入，导致每个Point calss object中都会存储一个指向virtual table的指针。其次，编译器会拓展默认构造函数，拷贝构造函数，拷贝赋值运算符\n\n对默认构造函数的拓展，需要在其中加上初始化virtual table pointer的代码。 This code has to be added after the invocation of any base class constructors but before execution of any user-supplied code. For example, here is a possible expansion of our Point constructor:// Pseudo C++ Code: internal augmentation\nPoint::Point( Point *this,float x, float y ):_x(x), _y(y)\n{\n// set the object's virtual table pointer\nthis->__vptr__Point = __vtbl__Point;\n// expand member initialization list\nthis->_x = x;\nthis->_y = y;\nreturn;\n}\n\n\n拷贝构造函数和拷贝赋值运算符都需要被显示合成的，他们现在不是trivial的了。(The implicit destructor remains trivial and so is not synthesized，also it's none virtual)\n\n其合成的函数中，vptr的设置不能简单的拷贝，比如如果是用派生类初始化基类。 其他的成员可能是copy member by member,or chunk by chunk \n// Pseudo C++ Code:\n// internal synthesis of copy constructor\nPoint::Point( Point *this, const Point &rhs )\n{\n  // set the object's virtual table pointer\n  this->__vptr__Point = __vtbl__Point;\n  // 'bitblast' contiguous portion of rhs'coordinates into this object or provide a member by member assignment ...\n  return;\n}\n\n当然，这些函数的合成，都是需要的时候再合成。\nline 7的拷贝\n*heap = local;\n\nis likely to trigger the actual synthesize of the copy assignment operator and an inline expansion of its invocation, substituting heap for the this pointer and local for the rhs argument.\n最后line 10， return of local by value，其转换如下\n// Pseudo C++ code: transformation of foobar()\n// to support copy construction\nvoid foobar( Point &__result )\n{\nPoint local;\nlocal.Point::Point( 0.0, 0.0 );\n// heap remains the same ...\n// application of copy constructor\n__result.Point::Point( local );\n// destruction of local object would go here\n// had Point defined a destructor:\n// local.Point::~Point();\nreturn;\n}\n\n如果可以应用NRV优化（前提是合成了拷贝构造函数，但是到目前为止并没有），进一步将拷贝构造函数的调用优化掉\n// Pseudo C++ code: transformation of foobar()\n// to support named return value optimization\nvoid foobar( Point &__result )\n{\n__result.Point::Point( 0.0, 0.0 );\n// heap remains the same ...\nreturn;\n}\n\nIn general, if your design includes a number of functions requiring the definition and return of a local class object by value, such as arithmetic operations of the form\nT operator+( const T&, const T& )\n{\n    T result;\n    // ... actual work ...\n    return result;\n};\n\nthen it makes good sense to provide a copy constructor even if the default memberwise semantics are sufficient. Its presence triggers the application of the NRV optimization. \nObject Construction under Inheritance\n当我们定义一个object如下：\nT object;\n实际上会发生什么事情呢？如果T有一个constructor（不论是由user提供或是由编译器合成），它会被调用．但这个constructor内部到底做了哪些事情呢？\n\nThe data members initialized in the member initialization list have to be entered within the body of the constructor in the order of member declaration.\nIf a member class object is not present in the member initialization list but has an associated default constructor, that default constructor must be invoked.\nPrior to that, if there is a virtual table pointer (or pointers) contained within the class object, it (they)must be initialized with the address of the appropriate virtual table(s).\nPrior to that, all immediate base class constructors must be invoked in the order of base class declaration (the order within the member initialization list is not relevant).\nIf the base class is listed within the member initialization list, the explicit arguments, if any, must be passed.\nIf the base class is not listed within the member initialization list, the default constructor (or default memberwise copy constructor) must be invoked, if present.\nIf the base class is a second or subsequent base class, the this pointer must be adjusted.\n\n\nPrior to that, all virtual base class constructors must be invoked in a left-to-right, depth-first search of the inheritance hierarchy defined by the derived class.\nIf the class is listed within the member initialization list, the explicit arguments, if any, must be passed. Otherwise, if there is a default constructor associated with the class, it must be invoked.\nIn addition, the offset of each virtual base class subobject within the class must somehow be made accessible at runtime.\nThese constructors, however, may be invoked if, and only if, the class object represents the \"most-derived class.\" Some mechanism supporting this must be put into place. \n\n\n\n现在Point的声明如下\nclass Point {\npublic:\n   Point( float x = 0.0, float y = 0.0 );\n   Point( const Point& );\n   Point& operator=( const Point& );\n   virtual ~Point();\n   virtual float z(){ return 0.0; }\n   // ...\nprotected:\n   float _x, _y;\n};\n\n现有Line类声明如下，composed of a begin and end point\nclass Line {\nPoint _begin, _end;\npublic:\n   Line( float=0.0, float=0.0, float=0.0, float=0.0 );\n   Line( const Point&, const Point& );\n   draw();\n   // ...\n};\n\nEach explicit constructor is augmented to invoke the constructors of its two member class objects. For example, the user constructor\nLine::Line( const Point &begin, const Point &end ): _end( end ), _begin( begin )\n{};\n\nis internally augmented and transformed into\n// Pseudo C++ Code: Line constructor augmentation\nLine::Line( Line *this, const Point &begin, const Point &end ): _end( end ), _begin( begin )\n{\nthis->_begin.Point::Point( begin );\nthis->_end.Point::Point( end );\nreturn;\n};\n\nSince the Point class declares a copy constructor, a copy assignment operator, and a destructor (virtual in this case), the implicit copy constructor, copy assignment operator, and destructor for Line are nontrivial.\n合成的析构函数不是virtual的(If Line were derived from Point, the synthesized destructor would be virtual. However, because Line contains only Point objects, the synthesized Line destructor is nonvirtual). Within it, the destructors for its two member class objects are invoked in the reverse order of their construction:\n// Pseudo C++ Code: Line destructor synthesis\ninline void Line::~Line( Line *this )\n{\n    this->_end.Point::~Point();\n    this->_begin.Point::~Point();\n};\n\nVirtual Inheritance\nclass Point3d : public virtual Point {\npublic:\n   Point3d( float x = 0.0, float y = 0.0, float z = 0.0 )\n   : Point( x, y ), _z( z ) {}\n   Point3d( const Point3d& rhs )\n   : Point( rhs ), _z( rhs._z ) {}\n   ~Point3d();\n   Point3d& operator=( const Point3d& );\n   virtual float z(){ return _z; }\n   // ...\nprotected:\n   float _z;\n};\n\nThe conventional constructor augmentation does not work due to the shared nature of the virtual base class:\n// Pseudo C++ Code:\n// Invalid Constructor Augmentation\nPoint3d::Point3d( Point3d *this, float x, float y, float z )\n{\n   this->Point::Point( x, y );\n   this->__vptr__Point3d = __vtbl__Point3d;\n   this->__vptr__Point3d__Point =__vtbl__Point3d__Point;\n   this->_z = z;\n   return this;\n}\n\nConsider the following three class derivations:\nclass Vertex : virtual public Point { ... };\nclass Vertex3d : public Point3d, public Vertex { ... };\nclass PVertex : public Vertex3d { ... };\n\nThe constructor for Vertex must also invoke the Point class constructor. However, when Point3d and Vertex are subobjects of Vertex3d, their invocations of the Point constructor must not occur; rather, Vertex3d, as the most-derived class, becomes responsible for initializing Point. In the subsequent PVertex derivation, it, not Vertex3d, is responsible for the initialization of the shared Point subobject.\n这种有时候需要调用virtual base class的构造函数，有时候又不需要，通常是通过对构造函数引入一个参数来实现的。 如下\n// Psuedo C++ Code:\n// Constructor Augmentation with Virtual Base class\nPoint3d::Point3d( Point3d *this, bool __most_derived,\nfloat x, float y, float z )\n{\nif ( __most_derived != false )\n    this->Point::Point( x, y);\nthis->__vptr__Point3d = __vtbl__Point3d;\nthis->__vptr__Point3d__Point = __vtbl__Point3d__Point;\nthis->_z =z;\nreturn;\n}\n\n后续派生的类，比如Vertex3d,其构造函数中，在调用Point3d 和 Vertex的构造函数时，都将__most_derived参数设置为false,suppressing the Point constructor invocation within both constructors\n// Psuedo C++ Code:\n// Constructor Augmentation with Virtual Base class\nVertex3d::Vertex3d( Vertex3d *this, bool __most_derived,\nfloat x, float y, float z )\n{\nif ( __most_derived != false )\n    this->Point::Point( x, y);\n// invoke immediate base classes,\n// setting __most_derived to false\nthis->Point3d::Point3d( false, x, y, z );\nthis->Vertex::Vertex( false, x, y );\n// set vptrs...\n// insert user code....\nreturn;\n}\n\n还有一种更为有效的实现，就是将constructor生成两份，一份用于完整对象的调用，其中会调用其virtual base class 的 constructor,sets all vptrs, and so on.另一份针对subobject， does not invoke the virtual base class constructors, may possibly not set the vptrs, and so on 。不过作者没有提供哪种编译器使用这种方式实现的。\nThe Semantics of the vptr Initialization\nWhen we define a PVertex object, the order of constructor calls is\nPoint( x, y );\nPoint3d( x, y, z );\nVertex( x, y, z );\nVertex3d( x, y, z );\nPVertex( x, y, z );\n\n假设这个继承体系中的每一个类中都声明了virtual function size() that returns the size in bytes of the class。下面代码\nPVertex pv;\nPoint3d p3d;\nPoint *pt = &pv;\n\nthe call\npt->size();\nwould return the size of the PVertex class and\npt = &p3d\npt->size();\nwould return the size of the Point3d class.\n在上述继承体系的类中，每个类的构造函数中都有对size的调用，如下\nPoint3d::Point3d( float x, float y, float z ) : _x( x ), _y( y ), _z( z )\n{\n   if ( spyOn )\n    cerr \n这样，PVertex的构造函数中，其各基类的构造函数的调用，其中对size的解析，是解析到PVertex::size()，还是解析到正在被构造的subobject的size呢？答案是解析到正在被构造的subobject的size。这是必须保证的，因为类的构造是从基类到派生类，在构造基类时，派生类还不完整，不能调用派生类的虚函数。但这是如何实现的？\n如果需要在构造函数或析构函数中调用虚函数，应该直接静态调用，比如上面的Point3d构造函数中对size的调用应该如下\nPoint3d::size()\n\n然而如果size函数中又有对虚函数的调用，这时候只能走虚函数机制调用了。虚函数的调用主要通过vptr,因此vptr的初始化时机就很重要了。vptr的初始化时机，After invocation of the base class constructors but before execution of user-provided code or the expansion of members initialized within the member initialization list\n一个构造函数的执行流程如下\n\nWithin the derived class constructor, all virtual base class and then immediate base class constructors are invoked.\nThat done, the object's vptr(s) are initialized to address the associated virtual table(s).\nThe member initialization list, if present, is expanded within the body of the constructor. This must be done after the vptr is set in case a virtual member function is called.\nThe explicit user-supplied code is executed.\n\n假设PVertex的构造函数如下\nPVertex::PVertex( float x, float y, float z ): _next( 0 ), Vertex3d( x, y, z ), Point( x, y )\n{\nif ( spyOn )\n  cerr \n按照如上的流程，会被拓展成\n// Pseudo C++ Code\n// expansion of PVertex constructor\nPVertex::PVertex( Pvertex* this, bool __most_derived, float x, float y, float z )\n{\n// conditionally invoke the virtual base constructor\nif ( __most_derived != false )\n    this->Point::Point( x, y );\n// unconditional invocation of immediate base\nthis->Vertex3d::Vertex3d( false,x, y, z );\n// initialize associated vptrs\nthis->__vptr__PVertex = __vtbl__PVertex;\nthis->__vptr__Point__PVertex = __vtbl__Point__PVertex;\n\nthis->_next=0;\n// explicit user code\nif ( spyOn )\n  cerr __vptr__PVertex[ 3 ].faddr)(this)\n  \n然而这个解决方案中，所有的base class 构造函数中都设置其vptr,而这个设置的值，很可能会在其下一层的派生类的构造函数中再次被设置。\n另一种构造函数vptr的设置，就是将构造函数实现成2分，一份针对完整的对象的构造函数实现，其中需要设置所有的vptr,另一个针对subobject的构造实现，其中vptr的设置，能省略就被省略。除非该构造函数中调用了虚函数，则vpr需要被设置。\n下面回答两个问题：\n\n在类的构造函数中，在其初始化列表中调用virtual function作为其数据成员的初始值，是否可以？\n\n如果仅从virtual function调用到正确的虚函数这一调度考虑，是可以的。因为 vptr is guaranteed to have been set by the compiler prior to the expansion of the member initialization list.\n而如果该函数中，需要访问未被初始化的数据成员，就是错误的了。总的来说，这种idiom是不推荐的。\n\n如果是调用virtual function作为基类的构造函数参数呢？\n\n这样绝对是错误的， The vptr is either not set or set to the wrong class.Further, any of the data members of the class that are accessed within the function are guaranteed to not yet be initialized.\nObject Copy Semantics\n当我们设计一个class，并以一个class object赋值给另一个class object时，\n我们有三种选择：\n\n什么都不做，因此得以实施默认行为。\n提供一个explicit copy assignment operator\n明确地拒绝把一个class object 赋值给另一个class object\n\n如果我们要实现第三点，那么可以将copy assignment operator声明为private,并且不提供其定义。\n把它设为private，我们就不再允许于任何地点（除了在member functions以及此class\n的friends之中）进行賦值（assign）操作．不提供其函数定义，则一旦某个member\nfunction或friends企图调用赋值操作，程序在链接时就会失败\n假设Point类声明如下\nclass Point {\npublic:\n   Point( float x = 0.0, y = 0.0 );\n   //...( no virtual functions\nprotected:\n   float _x, _y;\n};\n\n没有什么理由需要禁止拷贝一个Point object.因此问题就变成了：默认行为是否足够？如果我们要支持的只是一个简单的拷贝操作，那么默认行为不但足够而且有效率，我们没有理由再自己提供一copy assignment operator\n如果我们不对供应一个copy assignment operator，而光是依赖默认的memberwise copy，编译器会产生出一个copy assignment operator实体吗？这个答案和copy constructor的情况一样：实际上不会！由于此class已经有了bitwise copy语意，所以implicit copy assignment operator被视为毫无用处，也根本不会被合成出来．\n一个class在以下几种情况下不具有bitwise copy semantics:\n\nWhen the class contains a member object of a class for which a copy assignment operator exists\nWhen the class is derived from a base class for which a copy assignment operator exists\nWhen the class declares one or more virtual functions (we must not copy the vptr address of the righthand class object, since it might be a derived class object)\nWhen the class inherits from a virtual base class\n\n如果copy assignment operator不具有bitwise copy semantics时，copy assignment operator是nontrivial的，编译器会合成出具体的实例。\nFor our Point class, then, the assignment\nPoint a, b;\n...\na = b;\n\nis accomplished as a bitwise copy of Point b into Point a ; no copy assignment operator is invoked.\n假设我们提供了如下的copy assignment operator:\ninline Point& Point::operator=( const Point &p )\n{\n  _x = p._x;\n  _y = p._y;\n}\n\nNow let's derive our Point3d class (note the virtual inheritance):\nclass Point3d : virtual public Point {\npublic:\n  Point3d( float x = 0.0, y = 0.0, float z = 0.0 );\n  ...\nprotected:\n  float _z;\n}\n\nIf we do not define a copy assignment operator for Point3d, the compiler needs to synthesize one . The synthesized instance might look as follows: \n// Pseudo C++ Code: synthesized copy assignment operator\ninline Point3d& Point3d::operator=( Point3d *const this, const Point3d &p )\n{\n  // invoke the base class instance\n  this->Point::operator=( p );\n  // memberwise copy the derived class members\n  _z = p._z;\n  return *this;\n}\n\n那么假设Vertex也虚拟继承自Point,其合成的拷贝构造函数如下\n// class Vertex : virtual public Point\ninline Vertex& Vertex::operator=( const Vertex &v )\n{\n  this->Point::operator=( v );\n  _next = v._next;\n  return *this;\n}\n\n这时候，Vertex3d继承自Point3d和Vertex，那么合成的拷贝构造函数是不是就是如下呢？\ninline Vertex3d& Vertex3d::operator=( const Vertex3d &v )\n{\n  this->Point::operator=( v );\n  this->Point3d::operator=( v );\n  this->Vertex::operator=( v );\n  ...\n}\n\n这看上去是不对的，因为this->Point3d::operator=( v );和this->Vertex::operator=( v );中都调用了this->Point::operator=( v );,我们似乎应该像处理构造函数那样，给拷贝构造函数加上参数，只有most derived class中才会调用this->Point::operator=( v );,而中间的Point3d::operator=和Vertex::operator=不调用Point::operator=(); 但这种方法却不能被使用。因为不能给拷贝构造函数加额外参数。\nActually, the copy assignment operator is ill behaved under virtual inheritance and needs to be carefully\ndesigned and documented. In practice, many compilers don't even try to get the semantics right. They invoke each virtual base instance within each intermediate copy assignment operator, thus causing multiple instances of the virtual base class copy assignment operator to be invoked. Cfront does this as well as the Edison Design Group's front-end, Borland's 4.5 C++ compiler, and Symantec's latest C++ Compiler under Windows. My guess is your compiler does it as well. What does the Standard have to say about this?\nIt is unspecified whether subojects representing virtual base classes are assigned more than once by the implicitly defined copy assignment operator (Section 12.8)\n所以在使用virtual base class时要慎重了\nOne way to ensure the most-derived class effects the virtual base class subobject copy is to place an explicit call of that operator last in the derived class instance of the copy assignment operator:\ninline Vertex3d&\nVertex3d::operator=( const Vertex3d &v )\n{\nthis->Point3d::operator=( v );\nthis->Vertex::operator=( v );\n// must place this last if your compiler does\n// not suppress intermediate class invocations\nthis->Point::operator=( v );\n...\n}\n\nThis doesn't elide the multiple copies of the subobject, but it does guarantee the correct final semantics.\n我建议尽可能不要允许一个virtual base class的拷贝操作．更进一步：不要在任何virtual base class中声明数据。\nSemantics of Destruction\n如果class没有声明destructor,如果该类其member or base class 有destructor, 编译器才会給其合成析构函数。否则，the destructor is considered to be trivial and is therefore neither synthesized nor invoked in practice.\n如下的Point class，编译器时不会给其合成析构函数的，尽管其有virtual function\nclass Point {\npublic:\n  Point( float x = 0.0, float y = 0.0 );\n  Point( const Point& );\n  virtual float z();\n  // ...\nprivate:\n  float _x, _y;\n};\n\n如下的Line类，编译器也不会给其合成析构函数，因为Point类没有析构函数\nclass Line {\npublic:\n  Line( const Point&, const Point& );\n  // ...\n  virtual draw();\n  // ...\nprotected:\n  Point _begin, _end;\n};\n\n当我们从Point派生出Point3d,哪怕是虚拟派生，如果我们没有给Point3d声明一个destructor，编译器也不会为其合成一个destructor．\n考虑如下代码\n{\n  Point pt;\n  Point *p = new Point3d;\n  foo( &pt, p );\n  ...\n  delete p;\n}\n\n在调用foo( &pt, p );之前，pt 和 p指向的Point3d都必须初始化好，因此，有必要为其提供构造函数。\n否则的话，其值不仅没有初始化，而且是随机的，并不是零值，也就无法根据其是否是零值来判断是否初始化过了。\n而最后的delete p,需不需要提供析构函数呢？object占用的内存直接释放掉就可以了，并不需要对这块内存做任何特殊处理，所以不需要析构函数。 \n假设我们有个Vertex类，数据成员是vertices对象的list，析构时，需要按照顺序遍历链表，并释放每一个vertices.因此，其析构函数是显示提供的。\n如果Vertex3d派生自Point3d和Vertex,如果我们没有给Vertex3d显示提供析构函数，编译器会合成析构函数，在其中调用Vertex的析构函数。\nIf we provide a Vertex3d destructor, the compiler augments it to invoke the Vertex destructor after the user supplied code is executed. A user-defined destructor is augmented in much the same way as are the constructors, except in reverse order:\n\nIf the object contains a vptr, it is reset to the virtual table associated with the class.\nThe body of the destructor is then executed; that is, the vptr is reset prior to evaluating the user-supplied code.\nIf the class has member class objects with destructors, these are invoked in the reverse order of their declaration.\nIf there are any immediate nonvirtual base classes with destructors, these are invoked in the reverse order of their declaration.\nIf there are any virtual base classes with destructors and this class represents the most-derived class, these are invoked in the reverse order of their original construction.\n\n一个派生对象在析构过程中，随着从派生类到基类的析构函数被调用，其对象类型事实上也变成正在被释放的基类的类型。 A PVertex object, for example, becomes in turn a Vertex3d object, a Vertex object, a Point3d object， and then a Point object before its actual storage is reclaimed.\n每一层的析构函数中，首先都是reset vptr pointer，如果析构函数中有virtual function被调用，都是调用的当前正在被析构的类型的virtual function.\n"},"posts/c&c++/inside the c++ object model/Chapter 6.

Next we must generate temporaries to hold the return values of our function calls:\n\nGenerate a temporary of class X to hold the return value of getValue() :X temp1 = xx.getValue();\n\n\nGenerate a temporary of class Y to hold the return value of operator Y() :Y temp2 = temp1.operator Y();\n\n\nGenerate a temporary of type int to hold the return value of the equality operator:int temp3 = yy.operator==( temp2 );\n\n\nFinally, the language requires that we apply the appropriate destructor to each class object temporary. \n\n综上，最终转换成的代码如下\n// Pseudo C++ code\n// transformation of conditional expression:\n// if ( yy == xx.getValue() ) ...\n{\nX temp1 = xx.getValue();\nY temp2 = temp1.operator Y();\nint temp3 = yy.operator==( temp2 );\nif ( temp3 ) ...\ntemp2.Y::~Y();\ntemp1.X::~X();\n}\n\nObject Construction and Destruction\n通常，构造函数和析构函数的插入如下\n// Pseudo C++ Code\n{\nPoint point;\n// point.Point::Point() generally inserted here\n...\n// point.Point::~Point() generally inserted here\n}\n\n如果一个代码块{}或函数中有一个以上的离开点，情况会稍微混乱一些，Destructor必须被放在每一个离开点之前，例如：\n{\n   Point point;\n   // constructor goes here ...\n   switch( int( point.x() )) {\n      case -1:\n         // mumble;\n         // destructor goes here\n         return;\n      case 0:\n         // mumble;\n         // destructor goes here\n         return;\n      case 1:\n         // mumble;\n         // destructor goes here\n         return;\n      default:\n         // mumble;\n         // destructor goes here\n         return;\n   }\n   // destructor goes here\n}\n\n同样的道理，goto指令也可能导致需要多个destructor调用操作，例如下面的\n程序片段：\n{\n   if ( cache )\n      // check cache; if match, return 1\n   Point xx;\n   // constructor goes here\n   while ( cvs.iter( xx ))\n      if ( xx == value )\n        goto found;\n   // destructor goes here\n   return 0;\n   found:\n      // cache item\n      // destructor goes here\n      return 1;\n}\n\nGlobal Objects\n如下代码\nMatrix identity;\nmain()\n{\n   // identity must be initialized by this point!\n   Matrix m1 = identity;\n   ...\n   return 0;\n}\n\n如果identity有构造函数和析构函数的话，the language guarantees that identity is constructed prior to the first user statement of main() and destructed following the last statement of main() .\nA global object such as identity with an associated constructor and destructor is said to require both static initialization and deallocation.\nC++所有的全局变量都被放在数据段，要么有初值，要么是零值。\nThus in this code fragment:\nint v1 = 1024;\nint v2;\n\n数据段中，v1的值是1024，v2的值是0.（注意v2并不是放在bss段，c++所有全局变量都在数据段，不管有没有初始值）\n当然，如果全局变量是对象，构造函数并不是const expresssion,不能在编译期求值。Although the class object can be placed within the data segment during compilation with its memory zeroed out, its constructor cannot be applied until program startup.\n在进程startup时，给data segment中的object调用构造函数初始化全局对象，就是所谓的static initialization\ncfront 编译器对static initialization and deallocation的实现如下\n\n在需要静态初始化的每个文件中，生成一个包含必要构造函数调用的sti()函数。例如，identity会导致在文件matrix.c中生成以下sti()函数：__sti__matrix_c__identity() {\n// Pseudo C++ Code\nidentity.Matrix::Matrix();\n}\n\n其中，matrix_c 是文件名的编码，而 identity 则代表文件中定义的第一个非静态对象。将这两个名称附加到 __sti 上可在可执行文件中提供唯一标识符。\n同样地，在每个需要静态释放的文件中，生成一个包含必要析构函数调用的std()函数。在我们的例子中，会生成一个std()函数来调用Matrix析构函数并释放identity。\n_main()函数来调用可执行文件中的所有sti()函数，exit()函数类似地调用所有std()函数。\n\ncfront inserted a _main() call as the new first statement within main() . The exit() function rather than the C library exit() function was linked in by cfront's CC command、\n需要解决的最后一个问题是如何收集所有.o文件中的sti()和std()函数，看不懂，略\n以上的cfront的最初实现版本叫做munch，后来新的实现叫做patch，具体略。这两个实现版本都是通用的。\n一旦特定于平台的C++编译器开始出现，通过扩展link editor和目标文件格式以直接支持静态初始化和释放，就可以实现更高效的方法。例如，the System V Executable and Linking Format (ELF) 被扩展为提供.init和.fini sections ，其中包含有关需要进行静态初始化和释放的对象的信息。\nImplementation-specific startup routines (usually named something like crt0.o ) complete the platform-specific support for static initialization and deallocation.\nLocal Static Objects\n如下代码中有static local object mat_identity\nconst Matrix& identity() {\n  static Matrix mat_identity;\n  // ...\n  return mat_identity;\n}\n\nstatic local object有如下guaranteed semantics \n\nmat_identity must have its constructor applied only once, although the function may be invoked multiple times.\n\nmat_identity must have its destructor applied only once, although again the function may be invoked multiple times.\n\n\n一种实现策略是在程序启动时无条件构造对象。然而，这会导致所有static local objects在程序启动时初始化，无论它们的相关函数是否被使用。相反，更好的方法是仅在第一次调用identity()时构造mat_identity（这现在是标准C++所要求的）。我们该如何做到这一点？\n在cfront中，引入了一个临时变量来保护mat_identity的初始化。第一次调用identity()时，临时变量计算为false。然后调用构造函数，并将临时变量设置为true。这解决了构造问题。\n析构函数需要有条件地应用于mat_identity，但仅当mat_identity已被构建时才需要应用。确定它是否已经被构建很简单：如果临时变量为真，则它已经被构建了。\nstatic local object的析构应该在程序退出时，问题在于mat_identity was  local to the function，如何在函数外访问它？cfront 采用的方法是获取其地址。 static local object的地址在数据段中。\ncfront输出（稍微美化一下）：\n// generated temporary static object guard\nstatic struct Matrix *__0__F3 = 0 ;\n// the C analog to a reference is a pointer\n// identity()'s name is mangled based on signature\nstruct Matrix* identity__Fv ()\n{\n// the __1 reflects the lexical level\n// this permitted support for code such as\n// int val;\n// int f() { int val;\n// return val + ::val; }\n// where the last line becomes\n// ....return __1val + val;\nstatic struct Matrix __1mat_identity ;\n// if the guard is set, do nothing, else\n// (a) invoke the constructor: __ct__6MatrixFv\n// (b) set the guard to address the object\n__0__F3\n? 0\n:(__ct__1MatrixFv ( & __1mat_identity ),\n(__0__F3 = (&__1mat_identity)));\n...\n}\n\nFinally, the destructor needed to be conditionally invoked within the static deallocation function associated with the text program file, in this case stat_0.c:\nchar __std__stat_0_c_j ()\n{\n  __0__F3\n  ? __dt__6MatrixFv( __0__F3 , 2)\n  : 0 ;\n  ...\n}\n\nArrays of Objects\n假设我们有如下的数组定义\nPoint knots[ 10 ];\n\n如果Point既没有构造函数也没有析构函数，那么我们所需要做的和为内置类型数组一样分配足够存储10个连续的Point元素的内存空间。\n如果Point定义了默认构造函数，必须逐个应用于每个元素。通常情况下，这是通过一个或多个运行时库函数来完成的。在cfront中，我们使用了一个名为vec_new()的函数实例来支持创建和初始化类对象数组。更近期的一些实现中，在处理不含虚基类的类和含有虚基类的类时提供两个实例——一个通常被命名为vec_vnew() 。\n其签名通常如下，尽管在各种实现中存在变体：\nvoid* vec_new(\nvoid *array, // address of start of array\nsize_t elem_size, // size of each class object\nint elem_count, // number of elements in array\nvoid (*constructor)( void* ),\nvoid (*destructor)( void*, char )\n)\n\n其中，constructor和destructor分别是指向类的默认构造函数和析构函数的指针。array存储数组的地址或者为0。如果为0，则表示该数组通过应用 operator new 在堆上进行动态分配。elem_size参数表示数组中元素的数量。（在第6.2节中，我将讨论new和delete运算符。）在vec_new()函数内部，构造函数依次应用于elem_count个元素。析构函数对于异常处理的支持是必要的(it must be applied in the event the constructor being applied throws an exception)。Here is a likely compiler invocation of vec_new() for our array of ten Point elements:\nPoint knots[ 10 ];\nvec_new( &knots, sizeof( Point ), 10, &Point::Point, 0 );\n\n如果Point也定义了析构函数，那么在knots的生命周期结束时需要将其应用于每个元素。毫不奇怪，这是通过类似的vec_delete()（或对于具有虚基类的类而言是vec_vdelete()）运行时库函数来实现的。它通常具有以下签名：\nvoid*\nvec_delete(\nvoid *array, // address of start of array\nsize_t elem_size, // size of each class object\nint elem_count, // number of elements in array\nvoid (*destructor)( void*, char )\n)\n\nWhat if the programmer provides one or more explicit initial values for an array of class objects, such as the following:\nPoint knots[ 10 ] = {\nPoint(),\nPoint( 1.0, 1.0, 0.5 ),\n-1.0\n};\n\nFor those elements explicitly provided with an initial value, the use of vec_new() is unnecessary. For the remaining uninitialized elements, vec_new() is applied the same as for an array of class elements without an explicit initialization list. The previous definition is likely to be translated as follows:\nPoint knots[ 10 ];\n// Pseudo C++ Code\n// initialize the first 3 with explicit invocations\nPoint::Point( &knots[0]);\nPoint::Point( &knots[1], 1.0, 1.0, 0.5 );\nPoint::Point( &knots[2], -1.0, 0.0, 0.0 );\n// initialize last 7 with vec_new ...\nvec_new( &knots+3, sizeof( Point ), 7, &Point::Point, 0 );\n\nDefault Constructors and Arrays\n程序员不允许获取构造函数的地址。当然，这正是编译器在支持vec_new()时所做的。但是，通过指针调用构造函数时，如果构造函数有默认参数，这个默认参数如何获知？\n在cfront 2.0版本之前，声明一个类对象的数组意味着该类必须没有构造函数或者只有一个不带参数的默认构造函数。不允许使用带有一个或多个默认参数的构造函数。\n在cfront2.0之后，这个不合理的限制被修改了。\ncfront会生成一个不带参数的an internal stub constructor 。在函数体内，调用用户提供的构造函数，并将默认参数显式地指定。 Of course, the stub instance is generated and used only if an array of class objects is actually created.\nOperators new and delete\nint *pi = new int( 5 );\n\nit is actually accomplished as two discrete steps:\n\nThe allocation of the requested memory through invocation of the appropriate operator new instance, passing it the size of the object:// invoke library instance of operator new\nint *pi = __new ( sizeof( int ));\n\n\nThe initialization of the allocated object:*pi = 5;\n\n\n\nFurther, the initialization is performed only if the allocation of the object by operator new succeeds:\n// discrete steps of operator new\n// given: int *pi = new int( 5 );\n// rewrite declaration\nint *pi;\nif ( pi = __new( sizeof( int )))\n    *pi = 5;\n\nOperator delete is handled similarly. When the programmer writes\ndelete pi;\n\nthe language requires that operator delete not be applied if pi should be set to 0. Thus the compiler must construct a guard around the call:\nif ( pi != 0 )\n    __delete( pi );\n\nNote that pi is not automatically reset to 0 and a subsequent dereference, such as\nif ( pi && *pi == 5 ) ...\n\nmay or may not evaluate as true. This is because an actual alteration or reuse of the storage that pi addresses may or may not have occurred.\nThe allocation of a class object with an associated constructor is handled similarly. For example,\nPoint3d *origin = new Point3d;\n\nis transformed into\nPoint3d *origin;\n//Pseudo C++ code\nif ( origin = __new( sizeof( Point3d )))\n    origin = Point3d::Point3d( origin );\n\nIf exception handling is implemented, the transformation becomes somewhat more complicated:\n// Pseudo 3.C++ code\nif ( origin = __new( sizeof( Point3d ))) {\n  try {\n      origin = Point3d::Point3d( origin );\n  }\n  catch( ... ) {\n      // invoke delete lib function to\n      // free memory allocated by new ...\n      __delete( origin );\n      // propagate original exception upward\n      throw;\n  }\n}\n\nThe application of the destructor is similar. The expression\ndelete origin;\n\nbecomes\nif ( origin != 0 ) {\n  // Pseudo C++ code\n  Point3d::~Point3d( origin );\n  __delete( origin );\n}\n\nUnder exception handling, the destructor would be placed around a try block. The exception handler would invoke the delete operator and then rethrow the exception.\nThe general library implementation of operator new is relatively straightforward(Note: The following version does not account for exception handling.)\nextern void* operator new( size_t size )\n{\n  if ( size == 0 )\n    size = 1;\n  void *last_alloc;\n  while ( !( last_alloc = malloc( size )))\n  {\n    if ( _new_handler )\n        ( *_new_handler )();\n    else \n      return 0;\n  }\n  return last_alloc;\n}\n\nAlthough it is legal to write\nnew T[ 0 ];\n\n但通过上述的operator new的实现可见，即使数组大小是0， operator new都会至少返回一个指向默认 1 字节内存块的指针\n上述的operator new的实现中，_new_handler()是需要用户提供的，如果用户没有提供，则为null.\n实际上，operator new 一直是通过标准的 C malloc() 实现的，同样地，实际上 operator delete 也一直是通过标准的 C free() 实现的。\nextern void operator delete( void *ptr )\n{\nif ( ptr )\n    free( (char*) ptr );\n}\n\nThe Semantics of new Arrays\n当我们写如下代码\nint *p_array = new int[ 5 ];\n\nvec_new() 实际上并没有被调用，因为它的主要功能是将默认构造函数应用于类对象数组中的每个元素。Rather, the operator new instance is invoked:\nint *p_array = (int*) __new( 5 * sizeof( int ));\n\nSimilarly, if we write\n// struct simple_aggr { float f1, f2; };\nsimple_aggr *p_aggr = new simple_aggr[ 5 ];\n\n同上一样，vec_new() 实际上并没有被调用。因为 simple_aggr 没有定义构造函数或析构函数，数组的分配和删除只涉及实际存储空间的获取和释放。\nIf a class defines a default constructor, however, some version of vec_new() is invoked to allocate and construct the array of class objects. For example, the expression\nPoint3d *p_array = new Point3d[ 10 ];\n\nis generally transformed into\nPoint3d *p_array;\np_array = vec_new( 0, sizeof( Point3d ), 10, &Point3d::Point3d,&Point3d::~Point3d );\n\n这里传递析构函数，是为了在构造过程中如果出现异常，则已经构造完成的对象需要被释放。\n在2.0版本之前，程序员需要负责提供应用operator delete删除的数组的实际大小。因此，之前的分配，其释放应该写成\ndelete [10] p_array;\n\n在2.1版本中，语言已经修改。用户不再需要指定要删除的数组元素数目。因此我们现在可以写成：\ndelete [] p_array;\n\ncfront实现了 the storage and then the retrieval of the element count associated with the pointer.\n在delete时，编译器仅在方括号存在时才搜索维度大小。否则，它会假定正在删除单个对象。如果程序员未提供必要的方括号，则会出现错误，只有数组的第一个元素被析构，其余的元素未被析构，尽管它们关联的内存已经被回收。\nThe less error-prone strategy of checking all delete operations for a possible array entry was rejected as being too costly.\nthe storage and then the retrieval of the element count associated with the pointer 是怎么实现的呢？\n一个显而易见的方法是，为vec_new()操作符返回的每个内存块分配一个额外的字，并将element count存储在那个字中（通常，藏起来的值被称为cookie）。然而，Jonathan和Sun实现选择keep an associative array of pointer values and the array size.\ncookie strategy的问题在于，if a bad pointer value should get passed to delete_vec()，the cookie fetched would of course be invalid. An invalid element count and bad beginning address would result in the destructor's being applied on an arbitrary memory arena arbitrary number of times.Under the associative array strategy, however, the likely result of a bad address's being passed is simply the failure to fetch an element count\n我们大概看下关联数组的实现：\nWithin the original implementation, two primary functions were added to support the storage and retrieval of the element count \n// array_key is the address of the new array\n// mustn't either be 0 or already entered\n// elem_count is the count; it may be 0\ntypedef void *PV;\nextern int __insert_new_array(PV array_key, int elem_count);\n// fetches (and removes) the array_key from table\n// either returns the elem_count, or -1\nextern int __remove_old_array(PV array_key);\n\noriginal cfront implementation of vec_new() \nPV __vec_new(PV ptr_array, int elem_count, int size, PV construct )\n{\n  // if ptr_array is 0, allocate array from heap\n  // if set, programmer wrote either\n  // T array[ count ];\n  // or\n  // new ( ptr_array ) T[ 10 ]\n  int alloc = 0; // did we allocate here within vec_new?\n  int array_sz = elem_count * size;\n  if ( alloc = ptr_array == 0)\n    // global operator new ...\n    ptr_array = PV( new char[ array_sz ] );\n  // under Exception Handling,\n  // would throw exception bad_alloc\n  if ( ptr_array == 0)\n      return 0;\n  // place (array, count) into the cache\n  int status = __insert_new_array( ptr_array, elem_count );\n  if (status == -1) {\n    // under Exception Handling, would throw exception\n    // would throw exception bad_alloc\n    if ( alloc )\n      delete ptr_array;\n    return 0;\n  }\n  if (construct) {\n      char* elem = (char*) ptr_array;\n      char* lim = elem + array_sz;\n      // PF is a typedef for a pointer to function\n      PF fp = PF(construct);\n      while (elem \nvec_delete() works similarly, but its behavior is not always what the C++ programmer either expects or requires. For example, given the following two class declarations:\nclass Point { \npublic:\n  Point();\n  virtual ~Point();\n  // ...\n};\nclass Point3d : public Point { \npublic:\n  Point3d();\n  ~Point3d();\n  // ...\n}\n\nthe allocation of an array of ten Point3d objects results in the expected invocation of both the Point and Point3d constructor ten times, once for each element of the array:\n// Not at all a good idea\nPoint *ptr = new Point3d[ 10 ];\n\n而当我们如下调用delete时\n// oops: not what we need!\n// only Point::~Point invoked ...\ndelete [] ptr;\n\n传递给vec_delete()的析构函数，是根据指针类型来的，也就是传递的是Point::~Point。这样，不仅调用的析构函数不对，而且，传递给vec_delete()的元素大小，也是根据指针指向的对象大小来的，也不对。 Oops. The whole operation fails miserably. Not only is the wrong constructor applied, but after the first element, it is applied to incorrect chunks of memory.\n所以，直接使用派生类的指针来访问派生数组。\nPoint3d *ptr = new Point3d[ 10 ];\n\n书中所写的另一种方法，针对确实使用Point *ptr = new Point3d[ 10 ];Point指针存储返回的数组地址的情况\nfor ( int ix = 0; ix \n虽然对Point3d::~Point3d()的调用没问题了，但是在第一次delete时，整块数组的内存就被释放回malloc库了，后续的delete, 又在调用free释放回malloc库，这样会导致错误。\nTemporary Objects\n假设有关于class T的加法操作\nT operator+( const T&, const T& );\n\n假设有如下表达式\na+b;\n\na,b是class T, 该表达式的计算是否会产生栈外临时对象保存结果，一般来说视表达式的上下文和编译器的优化等级而定，假设如下代码段\nT a, b;\nT c = a + b;\n\n编译器可能会先对a+b的结果生成栈外临时对象，然后将该对象通过拷贝构造初始化c\n更可能的实现是，直接将a+b的结果拷贝构造给c,没有栈外临时对象的创建。\n如果编译器可以应用NRV优化，则可以直接在opeartor+()内部直接构造c。\n那么编译器到底会采用哪种方法呢？c++标准对临时变量的生成没有规定，由编译器自行决定，只要保证，无论哪一种情况，最终c的结果都是正确的就可以了。\n实现上，大部分编译器都会保证以下的表达式\nT c = a + b;\n\n其中加法操作，不管是这样定义的\nT operator+( const T&, const T& );\n\nor\nT T::operator+( const T& );\n\n都不会生成栈外的临时变量。\n然而，如果是赋值表达式\nc = a + b;\n\n是会生成栈外临时变量的。\n最后，如果表达式没有target:\na + b; // no target!\n\n这种情况，必然会产生一个保存结果的临时对象，这种在存在subexpressions的表达式中尤为常见\n比如，我们有如下变量\nString s( \"hello\"), t( \"world\" ), u( \"!\" );\n\n下述表达式\nString v;\nv = s + t + u;\n\n或\nprintf( \"%s\\n\", s + t );\n\nresults in a temporary being associated with the s + t subexpression.\n临时对象的释放时机很重要，比如，如果printf( \"%s\\n\", s + t );中，s+t subexpression temporary 的释放时机如下所示\n// Pseudo C++ code: pre-Standard legal transformation\n// temporary is destroyed too soon ...\nString temp1 = operator+( s, t );\nconst char *temp2 = temp1.operator const char*();\n// oops: legal but ill-advised (pre-Standard)\ntemp1.~String();\n// undefined what temp2 is addressing at this point!\nprintf( \"%s\\n\", temp2 );\n\n因此，C++标准给临时对象的释放时机做了如下的规定\nTemporary objects are destroyed as the last step in evaluating the **full-expression** that (lexically) contains the point where they were created. (Section 12.2)\nWhat is a full-expression? Informally, it is the outermost containing expression. For example, consider the following:　（注意表达式和语句，也就是　expression 和 statement的区别，这里关注的是full-expression和sub-expression）\n// tertiary full expression with 5 sub-expressions\n(( objA > 1024 ) && ( objB > 1024 ))\n? objA + objB : foo( objA, objB );\n\n这个表达式中，子表达式有5个，full expresssion是最外面的:?表达式。在最外面的:?被计算完成之前，其中的4个子表达式的计算所产生的临时变量，都是不能被释放的。\n这个规定，导致临时变量的释放，在条件表达式中的实现有点麻烦\nif ( s + t || u + v )\n{}\n\n本来，u+v生成的临时变量，只有在其被计算时，才会产生，从而需要被释放。现在需要等到||表达式计算完成之后，才能统一释放。因此，在释放时，就需要某种机制，知道到底u+v有没有被计算。\n也就是说，本来编译器可以做如下的转换\nclass X {\npublic:\n  X();\n  ~X();\n  operator int();\n  X foo();\nprivate:\n  int val;\n};\n\nmain() {\nX xx;\nX yy;\nif ( xx.foo() || yy.foo() );\nreturn 0;\n}\n\n被转换成\nint main (void ){\nstruct X __1xx ;\nstruct X __1yy ;\nint __0_result;\n// name_mangled default constructor:\n// X::X( X *this )\n__ct__1xFv ( & __1xx ) ;\n__ct__1xFv ( & __1yy ) ;\n{\n// generated temporaries ...\nstruct X __0__Q1 ;\nstruct X __0__Q2 ;\nint __0__Q3 ;\n/* each side becomes a comma expression of\n* the following sequence of steps:\n*\n* tempQ1 = xx.foo();\n* tempQ3 = tempQ1.operator int();\n* tempQ1.X::~X();\n* tempQ3;\n*/\n// __opi__1xFv ==> X::operator int()\nif ((((\n__0__Q3 = __opi__1xFv(((\n__0__Q1 = foo__1xFv( &__1xx )), (&__0__Q1 )))),\n__dt__1xFv( &__0__Q1, 2) ), __0__Q3 )\n|| (((\n__0__Q3 = __opi__1xFv(((\n__0__Q2 = foo__1xFv( & __1yy )), (&__0__Q2 )))),\n__dt__1xFv( & __0__Q2, 2) ), __0__Q3 ));\n\n\n{\n{\n__0_result = 0 ;\n__dt__1xFv ( & __1yy , 2) ;\n__dt__1xFv ( & __1xx , 2) ;\n}\nreturn __0_result ;\n}\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThis strategy of placing the temporary's destructor in the evaluation of each subexpression circumvents the need to keep track of whether the second subexpression is actually evaluated. However, under the Standard's lifetime of temporaries rule, this implementation strategy is no longer permissible. The temporaries must not be destroyed until after evaluation of the full expression—that is, both sides—and so some form of conditional test must be inserted now to determine whether to destroy the temporary associated with the second subexpression.\n临时对象的释放规则还就两个特殊情况做了补充，The first concerns an expression used to initialize an object; for example\nbool verbose;\n//...\nString progNameVersion =\n!verbose\n? 0\n: progName + progVersion;\n\n?:表达式的计算会生成progName + progVersion子表达式的临时对象，然而这个对象不能在?:计算完成后就被释放，还要初始化progNameVersion呢!\n因此标准做了如下的补充\n…the temporary that holds the result of the expression shall persist until the object's initialization is complete.\n但还是要注意如下的情况\n// Oops: not a good idea\nconst char *progNameVersion = progName + progVersion;\n\nprogNameVersion 指向的内存是临时对象的内存，这个内存在该表达式之后就被释放了，其转换如下\n// Pseudo C++ Code\nString temp;\noperator+( temp, progName, progVersion );\nprogNameVersion = temp.String::operator char*();\ntemp.String::~String();\n\n当然这种错误就应该算是程序员使用的错误了。\nThe second exception to the lifetime of temporaries rule concerns when a temporary is bound to a reference. For example,\nconst String &space = \" \";\n\ngenerates code that looks something like\n// Pseudo C++ Code\nString temp;\ntemp.String::String( \" \" );\nconst String &space = temp;\n\nObviously, if the temporary were destroyed now, the reference would be slightly less than useless. So the rule is that a temporary bound to a reference persists for the lifetime of the reference or until the end of the scope in which the temporary is created, whichever comes first.\n"},"posts/c&c++/inside the c++ object model/Chapter 7.

We cannot write\n// error:\nPoint::freeList;\n\nbut must specify the explicit template Point class instantiation with which the freeList member is associated:\n// ok:\nPoint::freeList;\n\n编译器在遇到以上代码时，首先会实例化Point 类，然后生成该类的freeList静态数据成员\n// ok: another instance\nPoint::freeList;\n\na second freeList instance is generated, this one associated with the double instantiation of the Point class.\n如果编译器遇到如下代码呢？会不会具象化一个Point类声明出来？\nPoint *ptr = 0;\n\n并不会，什么也不会发生。因为指向类对象的指针本身不是一个类对象；编译器不需要知道类的布局或成员。因此，生成Point类是不必要的。\n但如果是引用\nconst Point &ref = 0;\n\ndoes result in the instantiation of a float instance of Point. \nThe actual semantics of this definition expand as follows:\n// internal expansion\nPoint temporary( float (0) );\nconst Point &ref = temporary;\n\nWhy? Because a reference cannot be an alias to \"no object.\" The 0 is treated as an integer value that must be converted into an object of the type\nPoint\n\nIf there is no conversion possible, then the definition is in error and is flagged at compile time.\n所以，如果是类对象的定义，不管是由编译器隐式定义的临时对象，还是程序员显示定义的，如下\nconst Point origin;\n\n会实例化一个Point类，并定义一个origin对象。Point类对象有3个float数据成员。\n然而，以上的所有情况，member functions—at least those that are not used，都不会实例化的。Standard C++ requires that member functions be instantiated only if they are used (current implementations do not strictly follow this requirement).  There are two main reasons for the use-directed instantiation rule:\n\nSpace and time efficiency. If there are a hundred member functions associated with a class, but your program uses only two for one type and five for a second type, then instantiating the additional 193 can be a significant time and space hit.\n\nUnimplemented functionality. Not all types with which a template is instantiated support all the operators (such as i/o and the relational operators) required by the complete set of member functions. By instantiating only those member functions actually used, a template is able to support types that otherwise would generate compile-time errors.\n\n\n以上origin的定义\nconst Point origin;\n\n只需要实例化Point 的默认构造函数和析构函数。\n如下代码\nPoint *p = new Point;\n\n会实例化Point,operator new， default constructor会被实例化。\n(It's interesting to note that although operator new is implicitly a static member of the class and so may not directly access any of its nonstatic members, it is still dependent on the actual template parameter type because its size_t first argument is passed the class size.)\n那么函数是何时被实例化的呢？有2种实现策略\n\n在编译时。In which case the functions are instantiated within the file in which origin and p are defined.\n在连接时。In which case the compiler is reinvoked by some auxiliary tool. The template function instances may be placed within this file, some other file, or a separate repository.\n\nError Reporting within a Template\n假设有如下的模板类声明\n1. template \n2. class Mumble\n3. {\n4. public$:\n5.    Mumble( T t = 1024 )\n6.      : _t( t )\n7.    {\n8.      if ( tt != t )\n9.          throw ex ex;\n10.   }\n11. private:\n12.   T tt;\n13. }\n\nMumble模板类的声明包含了一系列明显和潜在的错误：\n\n第4行：使用$字符是不正确的。这个错误有两个方面：(1) $不是一个有效的标识符，(2) 在类声明体中只允许public、protected和private标签 (存在$时它不再被识别为关键字public)。\n第5行：将t初始化为整数常量1024可能合法也可能不合法，具体取决于T的实际类型。通常情况下，这只能针对每个模板实例进行诊断。\n第6行：_t并非成员名称；tt才是。这种类型的错误通常在类型检查阶段发现，during which each name is either bound to a definition or an error is generated.\n第8行：不等运算符(!= )是否被定义了取决于T的实际类型。与第二项相同，这只能针对每个模板实例进行诊断。\n第9行: 我们意外地输入了两次ex。这是编译过程中解析阶段发现的错误（语言中合法“句子”不能有一个标识符跟随另一个）。\n第13行: 我们忘记用分号结束类声明。同样，在编译过程中解析阶段发现了这个错误。\n\n在非模板类声明中，编译器在看到类声明时就会对这六个明显和潜在的错误做针对处理。然而，在模板中并非如此。首先，涉及模板参数的所有类型相关检查都必须推迟到实例化发生时。也就是说，示例中第5行和第8行（上面的2和4项）的潜在错误将针对每个实例进行检查和报告，并且将按类型逐个解决。因此，对于\nMumble mi;\n\n第5行和第8行的代码是正确的。\n但是如果是\nMumble pmi;\n\nline 8 is correct, but line 5 is a type error—you cannot assign a pointer an integer constant (other than 0).\nWith the declaration\nclass SmallInt\n{\npublic:\n  SmallInt( int );\n  // ...\n};\n\nwithin which the not-equal operator is not defined, the instance\nMumble smi;\n\ngenerates an error for line 8, while line 5 is correct. Of course,\nMumble psmi;\n\nonce again reverses that: Line 8 is again correct, but line 5 is again in error.\n那么，在处理模板声明时会出现哪些错误呢？这在一定程度上取决于模板的处理策略。在最初的cfront实现中，模板被完全解析但未进行类型检查。类型检查仅应用于每个特定实例化。因此，在解析策略下，所有词法分析和语法分析错误都将在处理模板声明期间被标记出来。\n词法分析器会捕获第4行的非法字符。 The parser itself would likely flag the\npublic$: // caught\n\nas an illegal label within the class declaration\n第6行的错误不会被标记出来,这种错误在类型检查阶段被发现，对于模板类，类型检查被延迟到实例化期间进行\n_t( t ) // not caught\n\nIt would catch the presence of ex twice in the throw expression of line 9 and the missing semicolon on line 13.\n另一种实现策略，模板声明被收集为一系列的lexical tokens。对这些token的解析被延迟到实例化期间。 在实例化时，每个tokens被push到解析器中解析，并应用类型检查，等等操作。\nWhat errors does a lexical tokenizing of the template declaration flag? Very few, in fact; only the illegal character used in line 4. The rest of the template declaration breaks up into a legal collection of tokens.\n非成员和成员模板函数在实例化之前也没有完全进行类型检查。在当前的实现中，这会导致一些明显不正确的模板声明编译时没有错误。For example, given the following template declaration of Foo:\ntemplate \nclass Foo {\npublic:\n  Foo();\n  type val();\n  void val( type v );\nprivate:\n  type _val;\n};\n\ncfront, the Sun compiler, and Borland all compile this without complaint:\n// current implementations do not flag this definition\n// syntactically legal; semantically in error:\n// (a) bogus_member not a member function of class Foo\n// (b) dbx not a data member of class\ntemplate \ndouble Foo::bogus_member() { return this->dbx; }\n\n再次强调，这是编译器的实现决策。模板机制本身并不排除对模板声明的非类型相关部分进行更严格的错误检查。此类错误可以被发现和标记。但目前为止，没有编译器这样做。\nName Resolution within a Template\nThere is a distinction between the program site at which a template is defined (called in the Standard the scope of the template definition) and the program site at which a template is actually instantiated (called the scope of the template instantiation). \nAn example of the first is\n// scope of the template definition\nextern double foo ( double );\ntemplate \nclass ScopeRules\n{\npublic:\n  void invariant() {\n    _member = foo( _val );\n  }\n  type type_dependent() {\n    return foo( _member );\n  }\n// ...\nprivate:\n  int _val;\n  type _member;\n};\n\nand an example of the second is\n//scope of the template instantiation\nextern int foo( int );\n// ...\nScopeRules sr0;\n\n在上述的两个scope中，有2个foo的调用，其中在第一个scope中，one declaration of foo()，extern double foo ( double );,而在第二个scope中，however, two declarations are in scope. \n如果我们有如下的调用\n// scope of the template instantiation\nsr0.invariant();\n\nthe question is, which instance of foo() is invoked for the call:\n// which instance of foo()?\n_member = foo( _val )\n\nThe two instances in scope at this point in the program are\n// scope of the template declaration\nextern double foo ( double );\n// scope of the template instantiation\nextern int foo( int );\n\nand the type of _val is int.\nSo which do you think is chosen?  Obviously, the instance chosen is the nonintuitive one:\n// scope of the template declaration\nextern double foo ( double );\n\n编译器在解析模板中的nonmember name时，具体解析到哪个定义，取决于 whether the use\nof the name is dependent on the parameter types used to instantiate the template. 如果对这个name的使用，跟模板实例化的类型参数无关，则使用template declaration scope中的定义。 否则的话，使用scope of the template instantiation\n上述例子中，foo的使用，其参数是_val,是个int类型的，与模板实例化的类型参数无关。同时，函数的解析只取决于其签名，也就是其参数类型，跟返回值无关。 因此，解析该函数，只能使用the scope of the template declaration， within this scope is only the one candidate instance of foo() from which to choose.\nLet's look at a type-dependent usage:\nsr0.type_dependent();\n\nWhich foo() does its call resolve to?\nreturn foo( _member );\n\nThis instance clearly is dependent on the template argument that determines the actual type of _member . So this instance of foo() must be resolved from the scope of the template instantiation, which in this case includes both declarations of foo() . Since _member is of type int in this instance, it's the integer instance of foo() that is invoked.\nMember Function Instantiation\n一般模板函数的定义被放在头文件中。\n有的编译器会在类模板实例化时，其所有的成员函数都会被实例化，有的仅实例化用到的函数\n模板的使用会导致编译时间增加。\n程序员可以显示的实例化一个类模板,包括其所有的成员函数\ntemplate class Point3d;\n\n显示实例化类模板的某个成员函数\ntemplate float Point3d::X() const;\n\n显示实例化某个函数模板\ntemplate Point3d operator+(\nconst Point3d&, const Point3d& );\n\nException Handling\nException Handling Overview\nException handling under C++ consists of the following three main syntactic components:\n\nA throw clause. A throw clause raises an exception at some point within the program. The exception thrown can be of a built-in or user-defined type.\nOne or more catch clauses. Each catch clause is the exception handler. It indicates a type of exception the clause is prepared to handle and gives the actual handler code enclosed in braces.\nA try block. A try block surrounds a sequence of statements for which an associated set of catch clauses is active.\n\nWhen an exception is thrown, control passes up the function call sequence until either an appropriate catch clause is matched or main() is reached without a handler's being found, at which point the default handler, terminate(), is invoked. As control passes up the call sequence, each function in turn is popped from the program stack (this process is called unwinding the stack). Prior to the popping of each function, the destructors of the function's local class objects are invoked.\nWhat is slightly nonintuitive about EH is the impact it has on functions that seemingly have nothing to do with exceptions. For example, consider the following:\n1. Point*\n2. mumble()\n3. {\n4.    Point *pt1, *pt2;\n5.    pt1 = foo();\n6.    if ( !pt1 )\n7.      return 0;\n8.\n9.    Point p;\n10.\n11.   pt2 = foo();\n12.   if ( !pt2 )\n13.     return pt1;\n14.\n15. //...\n16 }\n\n如果在第一次调用foo()（第5行）时抛出异常，则函数可以从程序栈中简单地弹出。该语句不在try块内，因此无需尝试与catch子句匹配；也没有需要销毁的本地类对象。但是，如果在第二次调用foo()（第11行）时抛出异常，则EH机制必须在将函数从程序堆栈展开之前调用p的析构函数。\n在EH下，第4-8行和第9-16行被视为函数的语义上不同区域，在抛出异常时具有不同的运行时语义。此外，EH支持需要额外的簿记工作。实现可以将这两个区域分别与要销毁的本地对象列表相关联（这些列表将在编译时设置），或者共享一个在运行时动态添加和缩小的列表。\nOn the programmer level, EH also alters the semantics of functions that manage resources. The following function includes, for example, both a locking and unlocking of a shared memory region and is no longer guaranteed to run correctly under EH even though it seemingly has nothing to do with exceptions:\nvoid mumble( void *arena )\n{\n  Point *p = new Point;\n  smLock( arena ); // function call\n  // problem if an exception is thrown here\n  // ...\n  smUnLock( arena ); // function call\n  delete p;\n}\n\nIn this case, the EH facility views the entire function as a single region requiring no processing other than unwinding the function from the program stack. Semantically, however, we need to both unlock shared memory and delete p prior to the function being popped. The most straightforward (if not the most effective) method of making the function \"exception proof\" is to insert a default catch clause, as follows:\nvoid mumble( void *arena )\n{\n  Point *p;\n  p = new Point;\n  try {\n    smLock( arena );\n    // ...\n  }\n  catch ( ... ) {\n    smUnLock( arena );\n    delete p;\n    throw;\n  }\n  smUnLock( arena );\n  delete p;\n}\n\nNotice that the invocation of operator new is not within the try block. Is this an error on my part? If either operator new or the Point constructorinvoked after the allocation of memory should throw an exception, neither the unlocking of memory nor the deletion of p following the catch clause is invoked. Is this the correct semantics?\nYes, it is. If operator new throws an exception, memory from the heap would not have been allocated and the Point constructor would not have been invoked. So, there would be no reason to invoke operator delete.\nIf, however, the exception were thrown within the Point constructor following allocation from the heap, any constructed composite or subobject within Point (that is, a member class or base class object) would automatically be destructed and then the heap memory freed. In either case, there is no need to invoke operator delete.  ???\nThe recommended idiom for handling these sorts of resource management is to encapsulate the resource acquisition within a class object, the destructor of which frees the resource:\nvoid\nmumble( void *arena )\n{\nauto_ptr  ph ( new Point );\nSMLock sm( arena );\n// no problem now if an exception is thrown here\n// ...\n// no need to explicitly unlock & delete\n// local destructors invoked here\n// sm.SMLock::~SMLock();\n// ph.auto_ptr ::~auto_ptr  ()\n}\n\nException Handling Support\nWhen an exception is thrown, the compilation system must do the following:\n\nExamine the function in which the throw occurred.\nDetermine if the throw occurred in a try block.\nIf so, then the compilation system must compare the type of the exception against the type of each catch clause.\nIf the types match, control must pass to the body of the catch clause.\nIf either it is not within a try block or none of the catch clauses match, then the system must (a) destruct any active local objects, (b) unwind the current function from the stack, and (c) go to the next active function on the stack and repeat items 2–5.\n\nDetermine if the Throw Occurred within a try Block\nA function, recall, can be thought of as a set of regions:\n\nA region outside a try block with no active local objects\nA region outside a try block but with one or more active local objects requiring destruction\nA region within an active try block\n\nThe compiler needs to mark off these regions and make these markings available to the runtime EH system. A predominant strategy for doing this is the construction of program counter range tables.\nRecall that the program counter holds the address of the next program instruction to be executed. To mark off a region of the function within an active try block, the beginning and ending program counter value (or the beginning program counter value and its range value) can be stored in a table.\nWhen a throw occurs, the current program counter value is matched against the associated range table to determine whether the region active at the time is within a try block. If it is, the associated catch clauses need to be examined. If the exception is not handled (or if it is rethrown), the current function is popped from the program stack and the value of the program counter is restored to the value of the call site and the cycle begins again.\nCompare the Type of the Exception against the Type of Each Catch Clause\nFor each throw expression, the compiler must create a type descriptor encoding the type of the exception. If the type is a derived type, the encoding must include information on all of its base class types. \nThe type descriptor is necessary because the actual exception is handled at runtime when the object itself otherwise has no type information associated with it. RTTI is a necessary side effect of support for EH.\nThe compiler must also generate a type descriptor for each catch clause. The runtime exception handler compares the type descriptor of the object thrown with that of each catch clause's type descriptor until either a match is found or the stack has been unwound and terminate() invoked.\nAn exception table is generated for each function. It describes the regions associated with the function, the location of any necessary cleanup code (invocation of local class object destructors), and the location of\ncatch clauses if a region is within an active try block.\nWhat Happens When an Actual Object Is Thrown during Program Execution?\nWhen an exception is thrown, the exception object is created and placed generally on some form of exception data stack. Propagated from the throw site to each catch clause are the address of the exception object, the type descriptor (or the address of a function that returns the type descriptor object associated with the exception type), and possibly the address of the destructor for the exception object, if one is defined.\nConsider a catch clause of the form\ncatch( exPoint p )\n{\n  // do something\n  throw;\n}\n\nand an exception object of type exVertex derived from exPoint. The two types match and the catch clause block becomes active. What happens with p?\n\np is initialized by value with the exception object the same as if it were a formal argument of a function. This means a copy constructor and destructor, if defined or synthesized by the compiler, are applied to the local copy.\nBecause p is an object and not a reference, the non-exPoint portion of the exception object is sliced off when the values are copied. In addition, if virtual functions are provided for the exception hierarchy, the vptr of p is set to exPoint's virtual table; the exception object's vptr is not copied.\n\nWhat happens when the exception is rethrown? Is p now the object propagated or the exception object originally generated at the throw site? \np is a local object destroyed at the close of the catch clause. Throwing p would require the generation of another temporary. It also would mean losing the exVertex portion of the original exception. The original exception object is rethrown; any modifications to p are discarded.\nA catch clause of the form\ncatch( exPoint &rp )\n{\n  // do something\n  throw;\n}\n\nrefers to the actual exception object. Any virtual invocations resolve to the instances active for exVertex, the actual type of the exception object. Any changes made to the object are propagated to the next catch clause.\nFinally, here is an interesting puzzle. If we have the following throw expression:\nexVertex errVer;\n// ...\nmumble()\n{\n  // ...\n  if ( mumble_cond ) {\n    errVer.fileName( \"mumble()\" );\n    throw errVer;\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n\nIs the actual exception errVer propagated or is a copy of errVer constructed on the exception stack and propagated? A copy is constructed; the global errVer is not propagated. This means that any changes made to the exception object within a catch clause are local to the copy and are not reflected within errVer. The actual exception object is destroyed only after the evaluation of a catch clause that does not rethrow the exception.\nRuntime Type Identification\nIntroducing a Type-Safe Downcast\nDowncasts are potentially dangerous because they circumvent the type system and if incorrectly applied may misinterpret (if it's a read operation) or corrupt program memory (if it's a write operation).\nOne criticism of C++ had been its lack of support for a type-safe downcast mechanism—one that performs the downcast only if the actual type being cast is appropriate . A type-safe downcast requires a runtime query of the pointer as to the actual type of the object it addresses. Thus support for a type-safe downcast mechanism brings with it both space and execution time overhead:\n\nIt requires additional space to store type information, usually a pointer to some type information node.(type_info )\n\nIt requires additional time to determine the runtime type, since, as the name makes explicit, the determination can be done only at runtime.\n\n\n那么，如果添加这种机制，对于某些不需要多态，不需要cast来cast去的程序而言，以上的overhead不应该存在的。尤其是，以下两种程序\n\nProgrammers who use polymorphism heavily and who therefore have a legitimate need for a type-safe downcast mechanism\nProgrammers who use the built-in data types and nonpolymorphic facilities and who therefore have a legitimate need not to be penalized with the overhead of a mechanism that does not come into play in their code\n\n为前者实现RTTI是最好的，但RTTI不应该对后者造成不必要的performance penalty.\nThe C++ RTTI mechanism provides a type-safe downcast facility but only for those types exhibiting polymorphism . Within C++, a polymorphic class is one that contains either an inherited or declared virtual function\n实现上，RTTI就可以利用已经实现了的虚函数机制。每个polymorphism class都会在编译期生成虚函数表，虚函数表的第一个slot存放指向type_info object的指针。这种实现方式的好处是，一是其额外的空间使用很少，每个class多一个指针，和该class对应的type_info oject.此外，在编译期就可以设置好该指针。在运行期，class object被construct时，设置的是class object中的vptr.\nA Type-Safe Dynamic Cast\nThe dynamic_cast operator determines at runtime the actual type being addressed. If the downcast is safe (that is, if the base type pointer actually addresses an object of the derived class), the operator returns the appropriately cast pointer. If the downcast is not safe, the operator returns 0.\n\nvoid Dynamic_Cast( Base * pb )\n{\n  if ( Derived *pd  = dynamic_cast( pb )) {\n      // ... process pd\n  }\n  else { ... }\n}\n\ndynamic_cast实际的执行就是首先通过((type_info*)(pb->vptr[0]))->_type_descriptor获取pb指向的对象的实际类型的类型描述符，然后获取 Derived type的类型描述符，最后将两者比较，如果相同，则转换成功。\n这种做法，相比于直接downcast，是要耗时很多的，但保证了安全性。\nReferences Are Not Pointers\nThe dynamic_cast operator can also be applied to a reference. The result of a non–type-safe cast, however,cannot be the same as for a pointer. Why? A reference cannot refer to \"no object\" the way a pointer does by having its value be set to 0. Initializing a reference with 0 causes a temporary of the referenced type to be generated. This temporary is initialized with 0. The reference is then initialized to alias the temporary. \nThus the dynamic_cast operator, when applied to a reference, cannot provide an equivalent true/false pair of alternative pathways as it does with a pointer. Rather, the following occurs:\n\nIf the reference is actually referring to the appropriate derived class or an object of a class subsequently derived from that class, the downcast is performed and the program may proceed.\nIf the reference is not actually a kind of the derived class, then because returning 0 is not viable, a bad_cast exception is thrown.\n\nvoid Dynamic_Cast( Base & pb )\n{\n  try{\n    Derived & pd = dynamic_cast( pb );\n    //...\n  }\n  catch (bad_cast){\n    //....\n  }\n}\n\nTypeid Operator\n也可以通过typeid 操作符实现安全的downcast\nvoid Safe_DownCast( Base & pb )\n{\n  if ( typeid( Derived ) == typeid( pb ))\n  {\n      Derived &pd = static_cast( pb );\n      // ...\n  }\n  else { \n    //... \n  }\n}\n\nThe typeid operator returns a const reference of type type_info. In the previous test, the equality operator is an overloaded instance:\nbool type_info::operator==( const type_info& ) const;\n\nand returns true if the two type_info objects are the same.\nWhat does the type_info object consist of? The Standard (Section 18.5.1) defines the type_info class as follows:\nclass type_info {\npublic:\n  virtual ~type_info();\n  bool operator==( const type_info& ) const;\n  bool operator!=( const type_info& ) const;\n  bool before( const type_info& ) const;\n  const char* name() const;\nprivate:\n  // prevent memberwise init and copy\n  type_info( const type_info& );\n  type_info& operator=( const type_info& );\n  // data members\n};\n\nThe minimum information an implementation needs to provide is the actual name of the class, some ordering  algorithm between type_info objects (this is the purpose of the before() member function), and some form of type descriptor representing both the explicit class type and any subtypes of the class. In the original paper describing the EH mechanism (see [KOENIG90b]), a suggested type descriptor implementation is that of an encoded string. (For alternative strategies, see [SUN94a] and [LENKOV92].)\nWhile RTTI as provided by the type_info class is necessary for EH support, in practice it is insufficient to fully support EH. Additional derived type_info classes providing detailed information on pointers, functions, classes, and so on are provided under an EH mechanism. MetaWare, for example, defines the following additional classes:\nclass Pointer_type_info: public type_info { ... };\nclass Member_pointer_info: public type_info { ... };\nclass Modified_type_info: public type_info { ... };\nclass Array_type_info: public type_info { ... };\nclass Func_type_info: public type_info { ... };\nclass Class_type_info: public type_info { ... };\n\nand permits users to access them. Unfortunately, neither the naming conventions nor the extent of these derived classes is standardized, and they vary widely across implementations.\nAlthough I have said that RTTI is available only for polymorphic classes, in practice, type_info objects are also generated for both built-in and nonpolymorphic user-defined types. This is necessary for EH support. For  example, consider\nint ex_errno;\n...\nthrow ex_errno;\nwhere a type_info object supporting the int type is generated. \n对此的支持延伸到用户程序：\nint *ptr;\n...\nif ( typeid( ptr ) == typeid( int* ))\n   ...\nUse of typeid( expression ) within a program, such as\nint ival;\n...\ntypeid( ival ) ... ;\nor of typeid( type ), such as\ntypeid( double ) ... ;\nreturns a const type_info&. The difference between the use of typeid on a nonpolymorphic expression or type is that the type_info object is retrieved statically rather than at runtime. 当然，type_info对象只在需要时才会生成。\nEfficient, but Inflexible?\nDynamic Shared Libraries\n通常情况下，在连接新版本的动态共享库时，只需要直接替换库文件就可以了，新的版本的共享库是默认直接连接的。但是，under the C++\nObject Model if the data layout of a class object changes in the new library version，则需要重新编译用户代码，\nThis is because the size of the class and the offset location of each of its direct and inherited members is fixed at compile time (except\nfor virtually inherited members). This results in efficient but inflexible binaries; a change in the object layout requires recompilation. Both [GOLD94] and [PALAY92] describe interesting efforts in pushing the C++ Object Model to provide increased drop-in support. Of course, the tradeoff is a loss of runtime speed and size efficiency.\nShared Memory\nWhen a shared library is dynamically loaded, its placement in memory is handled by a runtime linker and generally is of no concern to the executing process. \nThis is not true, however, under the C++ Object Model when a class object supported by a dynamically shared library and containing virtual functions is placed in shared memory. \n在虚函数表中，虚函数的地址应该是虚拟地址，因此，如果后续的进程连接该共享库，但是将其映射到不同的虚拟地址处，则会有很大的问题。\nThe problem is not with the process that is placing the object in shared memory but with a second or any subsequent process wanting to attach to and invoke a virtual function through the shared object. \nUnless the dynamic shared library is loaded at exactly the same virtual memory location as the process that loaded the shared object, the virtual function invocation fails badly. The likely result is either a segment fault or bus error. \nThe problem is caused by the hardcoding within the virtual table of each virtual function. \nThe current solution is program-based. It is the programmer who must guarantee placement of the shared libraries across processes at the same locations. \nA compilation system-based solution that preserves the efficiency of the virtual table implementation model is required. Whether that will be forthcoming is another issue.\n这本书的成书时间是1996年，过去快30年了，以上两个问题应该已经解决了。\n"}}}
