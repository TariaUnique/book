std::move is a C++ utility function provided by the <utility> header. It is a part of the C++11 standard and is used to indicate that an object can be treated as an rvalue.


It enables move semantics, which allows the resources owned by an object to be transferred from one object to another without copying. By using std::move, you can optimize the code by avoiding unnecessary copying of temporary objects.


When using std::move, you're signaling that the object can be treated as an rvalue, allowing the move constructor or move assignment operator to be called on the object. It's essential to understand that std::move doesn't perform the move â€“ it only changes the value category of the object (from lvalue to rvalue).


After an object is moved, the moved-from object should be considered in a valid, but unspecified state. It's crucial not to use or access the moved-from object, except for destructing or assigning a new value to it.


Here's an example:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string str = "Hello, world!";
    std::vector<std::string> v;

    // Using push_back and copying the string.
    v.push_back(str);
    std::cout << \"After copy, str is \"" << str << \"\\\"\n";

    // Using push_back with std::move - this will move the string without copying.
    v.push_back(std::move(str));
    std::cout << \"After move, str is \"" << str << "\"\n";

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the first push_back copies str, leaving it unchanged, while the second push_back uses std::move to move str into the vector, so the str contains an unspecified value after the move.

The implementation of std::move is quite simple, as it's just a utility function that changes an object's value category. Here's a basic implementation of std::move:

Since std::forward is removed, the call_process function will always call the process(int& x) overload, even for rvalues. The output will be:

```c++
template<typename T>
typename std::remove_reference<T>::type &&move(T &&t) noexcept {
    return static_cast<typename std::remove_reference<T>::type &&>(t);
}
```

It takes an object of any type T as a universal reference and returns an rvalue reference of the same type. The std::remove_reference is used for removing any reference qualifiers in case the input is an lvalue reference type. The static_cast performs the actual cast to an rvalue reference. By using std::move, we enable the move constructor or assignment operator for that object.
